      "body": "Timesheets can be processed on a day-by-day basis, giving managers a simple insight into who worked that day. From the timesheets list, click on the Approve timesheets button to access that day’s timesheets.  The day-by-day timesheets view shows staff that worked, or were rostered, that day. A big tick indicates if the shift has been approved. The cost column gives the total cost of the shift; changes to this column update the total cost at the bottom of the page in real time, but are not saved when the shift is approved.  Sometimes, you will see data that looks a bit odd. For example, you might see the first and third columns filled out as the start and end time. In this case, the employee pressed clock in, when they should have pressed clock out, at the end of their shift. If you find such errors, simply change times in the textboxes so that they are in the correct column before approving the shift.  You can use keyboard shortcuts to enter times in this view. Managers can also use the approve all as a handy shortcut, and can click the green button at the bottom to move on to the next day, if they are working through several days worth of shifts. Alternatively, click the calendar icon to go to any date.  Timesheets can have have one of three statuses: pending, approved, or deleted. When a timesheet is first created, it is pending. This means it’s a work in progress. As the timesheet’s employee clocks in or out, the timesheet is updated automatically — A new shift is added for each day. Each shift can be approved by a manager; when all of the timesheet’s shifts have been approved, the timesheet is considered complete, and is marked as approved. The approve button at the button of each timesheet is a shortcut for this — it marks all the timesheet’s shifts as approved, and the timesheet as approved if the timesheet is complete. If a timesheet is created in error or otherwise needs to be removed, it can be deleted. "

To delete a department, click the click the   expand icon next to department its name. Then, click the   trash icon. The department’s staff won’t be removed; they just won’t be members of this department anymore.  This action can't be reversed. PayAus’ flexibility allows you to add staff to more than one department. That’s great if, for example, you share staff between multiple locations or branches of your business. But how does work for reporting? PayAus lets you specify which department an employee should be classified under for reporting purposes. This means that reports such as “costs per department” will only include this employee’s costs once, under the correct department, preventing double ups or confusion. You can set the reporting department on the staff details page. If the employee is only part of one department, the reporting department will default to this, but you can change it to anything you like. If you don’t want this employee to be included in department-specific reports (for example, if they are a manager of a multiple departments but not a “member” of any), you can choose the blank option.

PayAus can process staff information from a MYOB employee card export. The exact export process depends on your version of MYOB, but they are all similar. MYOB has more information on the export process on their support site: There are three important rules to keep in mind when exporting your data; Not all MYOB versions have an email address field, so the staff you import may not come with emails. If so, random ones will be generated. If you want to let your staff log in to PayAus.com so they can see their timesheets, you'll need to set their emails and passwords yourself. You can read more about PayAus fields  here. From the staff page, follow the prompts to get to the Import From MYOB page.  Once you’ve exported your staff from MYOB, click the Browse button, and find where you saved the file to your computer. The button might look slightly different to how it does in the image below, depending on your web browser. You can also apply one or more tags to the staff that will be imported by entering them into the text box, separated by commas.  Click the Import Staff button when you’re ready. Importing can take a minute or two, depending on how many staff you have, so be patient — and don’t click the button again! When the import is complete you’ll see your new list of staff. If there were any errors in the import, PayAus will let you know what went wrong, and which line of the MYOB file was the culprit. The errors can be corrected by editing the MYOB .txt file, though if there are only a few that didn’t work, it may be easier to add them manually. Before you can sync your timesheets with Xero, you’ll need to configure a few things in your Xero account. From the staff page, follow the prompts to get to import staff from Xero.

Be aware that only approved timesheets will be exported. Learn more about PayAus timesheets…  MYOB offers business software for Mac & PC. PayAus can import data into the MYOB AccountRight suite of products. Before you can export your timesheets to MYOB, you’ll need to enable timesheets in MYOB.  Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by MYOB. To do this, click the Export to MYOB button on the export to… menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee’s timesheets, you can export just their data into MYOB. When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. Click here to see an example file. The file has the extension .txt. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file. Your staff in MYOB must have a Card ID which matches their PayAus employee number. An easy way to ensure this is to import your staff from MYOB when you start using PayAus. If staff are already in PayAus, you’ll need to check their details to ensure the employee number matches the MYOB Card ID. This short video shows the process of importing timesheets from PayAus into MYOB. For written instructions, read on… The following screenshots step you through a MYOB import.  In MYOB, go to the File menu, choose Import Data, then Timesheets.  Choose the appropriate configuration settings for the file you’ll import: Tab-delimited, first record is Header Record, identify employee by Emp. Card ID. When you click Continue, you’ll be prompted to choose a file. Choose the file you downloaded from PayAus, and you’ll see the next screen:  When prompted as to which fields to import, select Match All. A list of fields will appear in the far right column, under Matching Import File. The first field should be Emp. Co./Last Name. Click on this field (in the far right column) and it should disapear. Finally, click the Import button. Deselecting the Emp. Co./Last Name field forces MYOB to match staff by the Emp. Card ID field, which is the field PayAus uses to match data to MYOB. It’s very important you do this, or your MYOB imports are likely to not work correctly. Click Import to commence the import process. When the process is complete you’ll see a message with the results of your import. Contact PayAus if you get any errors you are unable to fix. You should now be able to process payroll in MYOB using the timesheet data you have imported. Before you can sync your timesheets with Xero, you’ll need to configure a few things in your Xero account. PayAus will only export approved timesheets to Xero.

Contact PayAus if you get any errors you are unable to fix. You can view your timesheets at Payroll > Timesheets in Xero, and you should be able to process pay runs through Xero using these timesheets. You may see one of the following error messages when exporting your timesheets to Xero. Here’s some advice on fixing them. Earnings Rate (ID and name) does not exist. There are two common causes of this: The timesheet is not a Draft timesheet. You are attempting to export a timesheet in place of an already approved Xero timesheet. Either unapprove, or delete, the timesheet in Xero. Provided period doesn’t correspond with a pay period. There is a mismatch between the payroll calendar your Xero employee is on, and the timesheet period in PayAus. For example, you may have configured PayAus to use weekly timesheets, but your employee may be on a fortnightly payroll calendar. If possible, change the employee’s payroll calendar in Xero. If you have misconfigured PayAus and need to fix your timesheet calendar, contact us. Employee (ID and name) doesn’t have a pay run calendar. This employee has not got a Xero payroll calendar. Fix this by choosing a payroll calendar for them. TrackingItemID is required for each timesheet line. There are two possible causes. In either case, you should ensure that your settings are in sync. If these tips don’t help fix the issue, contact PayAus. Providing a screenshot of the error messages you got helps us fix the issue faster. Reckon Accounts provide business and personal finance solutions, previously known as QuickBooks and Quicken. PayAus can import timesheet data into Reckon systems.

To do this, click the Export to Reckon button on the Export to… menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee’s timesheets, you can export just their data into Reckon. When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. Click here to download an example file. The file has the extension .iif (“Intuit Interchange Format”) but is structured as a plain text file. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file. Click here for more information about the iif file format. Before importing data into a Reckon system, you will need to ensure that payroll has been enabled. First, add the payroll menu item. Then, set up your employee payroll information. When adding employee data, ensure that your employee names match to your staff names in PayAus exactly. Once you have set up your employees for payroll, you can import the timesheet data from the iif file. To do so, choose Import from either the File menu, or the Utilities submenu of the File menu.  You may be prompted to back up your company file before importing; do so. Finally, navigate to where you saved the iif file you downloaded from PayAus, and select this file. It will be imported into Reckon automatically.  See this guide for more information about importing iif files into Quickbooks and similar systems, and this guide for more information about iif files.

It starts with the basics — name, date range, and status. This timesheet’s status is pending, and it goes from April 15 to April 28. However, the clock-ins on the timesheet only go to April 20, as it’s ongoing. Click the comment icon to see comments on the timesheet. You can use keyboard shortcuts to enter times in this view.  Kyle worked a fairly standard seven and a half hour shift today. His lunch break looks a bit short — according to the timesheet, he was only out for 12 minutes. But, given that his clock-in after lunch is not verified, it may be worth checking up on.    \tPayAus doesn't know Kyle personally. He could be the most honest guy in the business, and just a tad forgetful with his clock-ins! PayAus simply helps to draw your attention to possible areas of concern in your business.     Tuesday is all good, and has been approved by a manager. Approve a shift using the thumbs   up/  down icons on the left hand side.  Like Monday, Kyle was forgetful on Wednesday, hence some of the times are unconfirmed. He is also claiming quite short lunch breaks again.  Thursday, like Tuesday, has been approved. It was a full eight hour shift.  Kyle worked the late shift on Friday; 8 PM Friday night until 4:30 AM on Saturday morning. The yellow highlighting, and “AM” suffix, draw attention to this — if you want to mark any other time on the timesheet as being “overnight”, you can so simply by appending an “AM”. You should see the yellow highlighting appear automatically when you do. There are no breaks entered here. If that is incorrect, but you don’t know what times the breaks were taken, you can simply update the Break column (the last textbox) with the correct number of minutes, and click the Update button at the bottom. The orange highlighting indicates that the break has been overriden.   Kyle was back at work early Saturday morning. Is that legal? Depends on his EBA — probably worth looking in to.  The final row of the timesheet shows the totals for the lengths of breaks, lengths of shifts, and cost of shifts.  This button saves the current state of the timesheet. Lengths of breaks (unless overridden) and shifts are re-calculated, as are the associated costs. This button verifies all times in the timesheet. That’s the equivalent of looking at the timesheet and saying “all these times seem fine, Kyle’s just a bit forgetful - all good!”. This action can't be reversed. You may prefer to only verify individual times. You can do this by clicking on an unverified time, clicking the tick in the popover, and then clicking the Update button to save your changes.  Learn more about verifications. This sets the status of each shift to approved. If the timesheet is complete (not ongoing), it will also be marked as approved. The timesheet is deleted. It will not be seen again. This action can't be reversed."

PayAus can do this for you. Just click the link at the top of any roster.  Sending rosters by SMS is a simple process. Usually you won’t need to configure anything — just click send. By default, rosters will be sent to all staff who have a schedule entered in the relevant roster, and who have a phone number in PayAus. To make things even easier, PayAus even shows you a preview of the message that will be sent on the right hand side of the screen when you hover over someone’s name.

First, you’ll need to give the award a name. This name must match the name that you’ve given this award in your accounting package. See the background to awards for more information. Then, choose when the award applies, and who it applies to. Awards are applied to shifts based on how specific they are, so an award that applies only on certain days will override one that applies all the time. For example, you could create an award for all your staff that applies all the time, and call it “Base Hourly”, then you could create an award for “Weekend Rates” that only applies on weekends.  PayAus is able to automatically import some award data from Xero. First, create your earnings rates in Xero (or just use Xero’s default set). Then, click the “Import from Xero” button on the award list.  If you haven’t recently done so, you’ll be redirected to a screen where you can authorise PayAus to access your Xero account. Choose your Xero organisation and click Authorise.  PayAus will then import your earnings rates from Xero. Once they’ve been imported, you’ll need to edit them to add details that PayAus could not discern. Generally, this will be details such as which date the award applies, and any particular times it may occur — as Xero does not store this information, but PayAus requires it to interpret your awards correctly.

For example, if your staff’s award applies a multiplier of 1.5 on weekends, you could create a Wage named Weekend Rate with a multiplier of 1.5 in MYOB. See these guides on MYOB’s support site for more information about Payroll Categories: Next, create a PayAus award named Weekend Rate that applies to all staff on weekends.

See Xero’s guide to pay items for more information about payroll in Xero. Reckon handles awards similarly to MYOB, but it refers to them as “Pay Items”. Wage Easy is able to perform some award interpretations automatically. Third party applications, such as PayAus, are not able to import interpreted data into Wage Easy.

      "body": "Your settings page gives you control over the functionality of your PayAus system. Use it to configure key aspects of the system, such as the timesheeting algorithm, function. Access the settings page from the menu in the top right corner.  The settings page is split into several categories… Configure settings relating to timesheet. Rounding will be applied to the clock-in/out times for staff when their timesheets are updated. This is split in to two different fields, so you can configure different rounding for clock-ins and clock-outs. When staff clock in, the time of their clock-in will round up, if enabled. When staff clock out, the time of their clock-out will round down, if enabled. For example, if both increments are set to 15, all times on timesheets will appear in 15 minute increments. So, if an employee clocks in at 8:50 AM, it will appear on their timesheet as 9:00. If an employee clocks out at 5:05 PM, it will appear on their timesheet as 5:00 PM — if they clock out at 5:23 PM, it will appear as 5:15 PM. Set these settings to 0 (zero) to disable them. You are able to enable one but not the other — for example, you could round clock-ins up in 15 minute increments, but keep clock-outs at their exact time by setting it to 0. In aggressive mode, shift rounding is applied as described above — it is called “aggressive” mode because it requires employees to clock in before their start time, and clock out after, their finish time, if they do not wish to have time docked. If aggressive mode is disabled, rounding is done to the nearest interval. For example, if rounding of 15 minutes is enabled and someone clocks in at 8:49 AM, it will round down to 8:45 AM, but if they clock in at 8:54 AM it will round up to 9:00 AM. Aggressive mode is disabled for clock-ins and clock-outs by default. It can be toggled for either category, or both. If enabled, a clock-in or clock-out will have its time rounded to the appropriate rostered time. The appropriate roster is determined using the shift rounding interval (so you must set that to a number greater than zero, or this rounding will never take effect). For example, if someone is rostered to start work at 9 AM with the rounding interval of 30 minutes: If aggressive mode has been enabled, rounding will only be applied aggressively. So in the above example, the 8:45 AM clock-in would be rounded to 9 AM, but the 9:15 AM clock-in would be left as is. The inverse applies for clock-outs. Rostered time rounding is disabled by default. The longest permissible length of a shift, in hours. This is used to determine where one shifts ends and another one finishes, which is used for a variety of calculations. For example, if someone clocks in at 2am, the system checks if this is part of a previous shift (ie. an overnight shift) by using this setting. The default is 12 hours, but that won’t work for all industries. For example, restaurants generally set this to 15 or 16 hours. The exact value will depend on your industry and rostering practices. Be careful when setting this to anything lower than 10 hours as it may break in cases of legitimate overtime. Your award should mandate a minimum number of hours between shifts. This setting, in conjunction with the maximum shift length, it is to parse incoming clock-ins and determine if they are part of an existing shift or a new one. This is especially important for overnight shifts. The default is 10 hours, but check your award and the hours your staff generally work. Every time a timesheet’s shift is automatically generated, a tag can be applied to it. This tag may come in handy when exporting data to an accounting system or for reporting purposes. Here you can choose how this tag is applied. The default is to use the name of the time clock that the employee clocked in via (unless they used the employee portal). This data is included when exporting timesheet data for payroll. Read more about timesheet tags. If checked, a shift will have up to four actions: a start, and break start, a break end, and a finishing time. Breaks will be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will be exported with timesheets. If not checked, a shift will have up to two actions: a start and a finishing time. Breaks will not be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will not be exported with timesheets. If your staff do not get unpaid lunch breaks (ie. all their breaks are paid) you should disable breaks. If specified, a break of this length (in minutes) will automatically be applied to shifts which do not otherwise have a break. This is useful if staff have a fixed break reduction applied to their hours, irrespective of if they take a break or not. Breaks are applied to shifts automatically when staff clock in or out, and are highlighted in orange on timesheets. This setting does nothing if breaks are disabled. Set this setting to 0 (zero) to disable it. If specified, only shifts of this length or longer (in hours) will have an automatic break length applied. Set this setting to 0 (zero) to disable it. If this is disabled but an automatic break length has been set, the automatic break length will apply to all shifts. If enabled, employees are able to edit fields such as shift allowances and shift tags when vieiwng their timesheets. If disabled, only managers and above are able to do so. This is disabled by default. Configure settings relating to clock-ins — the method by which data is entered into timesheets using portals. Enable the phone app, an alternative method for staff to clock in. Clock-ins that occur closer together than this number of minutes will be treated as duplicates and handled differently by the timesheet algorithm. This is useful for cases such as: In this case, the initial clock out, and subsequent clock in, are ignored. The final clock out (when Nick actually starts his break) are used. Set this setting to 0 (zero) to disable it. In this case, no action will be considered a duplicate (all actions will be recorded separately). 5 minutes is a sensible default for most work environments. You can use tags to freely categorise shifts on rosters. Sometimes you will need to add a second level of categorisation based on a department. Enable this setting (which is disabled by default) to do so. When this setting is enabled, shifts will automatically be categorised by department, based on the department filters you have applied to the roster. You’ll see a message like this at the bottom of your roster to indicate that shifts are being categorised automatically:  Note that a shift is categorised based on the department you are currently viewing. If you don’t see the message at the bottom of the roster, ensure that you have filtered your roster by department! If you want to re-categorise a shift into another department, delete it while viewing the department it’s in, then re-create it in while vieiwng the department you’d like to move it to. When you create a shift in this view, it will be linked to a department. Hover over the department’s initials to see its full name:  This department is included when sharing rosters with staff:  When you go to create a new team member, they have a passcode automatically generated for them. You are welcome to change this passcode, but often it’s handy to not have to come up with one. The passcode that is generated will be of the length specified here. A length of four is a sensible default for most businesses. If you have a lot of staff, or want to make passcodes harder to guess, you should set a longer length. If enabled, weekends will be shown on timesheets and rosters. This is the default If disabled, Saturdays and Sundays will not show up when viewing a timesheet or roster, unless someone has clocked in on that day. The title to use when displaying the roster tags field. This will be used when sending rosters out by email, SMS, or print, as well as being used internally when displaying rosters. You can give it a name that better describes your use for the tag, such as “Location”. The default is “Tags”. If enabled, managers will be able to see staff hourly rates and costs on timesheets, rosters, and staff profiles. If disabled, this data will be hidden from managers, and will only be visible to organisation admins, payroll officers, and roster managers. This is enabled by default. If enabled, managers are able to send rosters to staff by email or SMS. If disabled, only organisation admins and roster managers can. This is enabled by default. If you have set up payroll tracking categories in Xero, you will need to enter the name of the tracking category you are using here. For example, in the image below, you would enter “Job” as the tracking category name.  When you set up a tracking category in Xero, you create one or more options for that category. Here you should enter the default tracking option. When PayAus exports your timesheets to Xero, it uses the shift’s tag to attempt to match to a tracking category option. If it is not able to match one, the default option is used. This is important because you cannot import timesheets into Xero without entering a tracking category option if you have enabled timesheet tracking (just as you cannot create a timesheet manually without one in that case). Therefore, make sure that the option you enter here is one of the options available for the tracking category you entered above. The Talent2 export format requires a Client ID, which identifies your organisation to Talent2 payroll processing. Contact your Talent2 account manager to get your Client ID. It should be five characters, eg “PA674”."

Check back regularly to make sure you’re keeping under budget. While viewing a roster, either in full or for a particular department or tag, you’re be able to set a cost guide for the visible portion of the roster. PayAus then determines how close you are to that cost guide, as a percentage. You can enter any number you like in the cost guide field. For example, you could enter a target cost for the roster (as done in the screenshot below). Alternatively, you could enter a sales target, and advise managers that the roster can’t exceed 30% of the target. The important point is to be aware of your target percentage and work with it when designing your roster. Cost guides for an entire roster, and department-specific cost guides, are separate. So you can have a cost guide for each department’s roster, and an entirely different cost guide for the complete roster. You can save the cost guide amount by changing view or clicking the Save button.  When viewing a roster for all departments, you’re able to enter a number into the Fixed Costs field. This amount is added to the total cost of your roster. This is useful if there is a fixed overhead you must take into account when budgeting your rosters.

      "body": "PayAus allows you to track various allowances alongside your timesheets easily. For example, a pizza restaurant may pay a fixed rate for each pizza delivered, or a farm may pay a fixed rate for each sheep sheered. Using PayAus, you can enter this allowance data while managing timesheets, and export it to your accounting package automatically. To get started, create your allowances on the shift allowances page (accessed via the Payroll menu).  When creating an allowance, you can enter a name and an export name. The name is used by PayAus to refer to the allowance, so it can be anything you like — we suggest making it something short and memorable. The export name is used by your accounting system, so, just like a PayAus award, it should match the name in your accounting system exactly.  Once you have created an allowance, you’ll see a new column in your timesheets. This column is where you can specify allowance values for each shift. At the top of the column is a drop down menu — if you have multiple allowances, you can switch between allowances using that menu. You can also set allowances on the daily approvals page using the same form.  Use the configuration on the allowances form to have your allowances automatically be applied when someone clocks in or out. The fields available are similar to the award fields, as well as some additional ones:  The number of units to apply will be applied based on the following settings:  \t\tAllowances are automatically applied when staff clock in or out, but not when you edit timesheets manually. \t When you export your timesheet data for payroll, allowance data will be included in the file you export. As seen in this example MYOB file, there is an extra line for each shift which contains the allowance data entered into the timesheet. This would be mapped to a wage category called “Pizza Deliveries Base” in MYOB. Other systems which import data from text files, such as Quickbooks, will behave similarly. Xero allows you to create “allowance” Pay Items, but these can only be applied during Pay Runs, not on Timesheets. As a result, they can not be imported from other systems, such as PayAus. A workaround is available — simply create your allowance as a regular, “Ordinary Time”, Pay Item, with a name that matches the export name in PayAus. Ensure that the unit type is set to “Hours”, so that it works with Xero timesheets. The data can then be correctly imported from PayAus to your Xero timesheets. While this will generally not cause any other issues, though it may look a bit odd on payslips. You may wish to consult your accountant or bookkeeper if you use this workaround."

Tags can also be applied to staff and linked to awards for payroll. Roster tags are included when you distribute rosters by print, email, or SMS, so you can use them to include data such as the location of a shift. They are also useful in helping you to build rosters quickly and collaboratively. Timesheet tags are exported to your accounting system which is useful for job categorisation. Staff tags are used to determine which employees should have a particular award apply to them.  Tags can be managed on the tags page, accessible via the site navigation. You can create as many tags as you like, and (optionally) assign colours to them. These colours are used to colour code your rosters.  Create a new tag by entering its name in the box at the bottom and clicking the plus (+) icon, or pressing enter on your keyboard. The tag is created instantly, and you are then able to edit it and add a colour. Edit a tag by clicking on its name or colour. You can enter a new name in free text, or choose a colour from the drop down menu. Changes are saved instantly. If you change a tag’s colour, all shifts with that tag have their colour updated immediately. Delete tags using the delete link next to each tag. If you delete all your tags, the default colour palette will return to your rosters. In your settings there is an option to configure how tags are referred to across the system. You can make this anything you like. For example, set it to “Locations”, and when staff get their rosters sent out to them, the roster will include the “location” of each shift. Tags are used on your rosters to categorise shifts, using colour coding. This colour coding is then used when sharing your rosters, enabling you to add extra data (for example, a location) when sharing a roster. In a nutshell, roster tags create a meaningful mapping between the colour coding on your rosters, and an extra set of data. You can use the colour coding menu in week view to change a shift’s colour, and thus, its tag. At the bottom of each roster view is a legend of each tag and its corresponding name and colour.  When you are viewing a roster, you can filter it out to only show shifts with a particular tag. While you are filtering a roster by a specific tag, all new shifts created in the roster will have that tag applied (and will thus appear in the appropriate colour).  You are able to change the a shift’s tag in week view only. In day view, shifts will appear in their tagged colour, but the tag cannot be changed. As well as using roster tags, you can also categorise roster shifts by departments. There is a system setting which allows you to give a title for roster tags, which will be used when they are presented across PayAus. This defaults to “Tags”, but you can change it to anything you like. When a roster is shared by email, tags will show up as an additional column alongside each shift.  This tag will also appear when sending a roster out by SMS. Note that messages may need to be split into multiple parts to include tag data.  Finally, tags are included when a roster is printed. Note that in this screenshot, the title of the tags field has been set to “Location”.  You can add a tag to a shift in a timesheet by using the drop down menu.  When you export data to your accounting system, this tag will be included in the export. How the data is exported differs depending on the package: Learn more about exporting timesheet data for payroll. In your settings there is an option to configure how timesheets are tagged automatically. On your staff profiles, you’re able to configure tags for each employee. Tags can be configured in two ways: For example:  When creating an award, you are able to set it to staff tagged with one or more tags. This will be determined based on the award tag on the employee’s profile. "

These fields all impact on the effectiveness of the award interpreter so it is important to get them right! Contact PayAus Support if you ever need a hand. The name of the award must exactly match the name of the appropriate pay item (or earnings rate, or wage category, etc.) in your accounting package. Choose when this award should apply. For general awards that apply on any day, choose “Always”. Otherwise, check the appropriate boxes to fill out the criteria. It is possible to have an award only apply on a specific day and time. For example, you can have an award only apply on Wednesdays (using the Specific Days option) between 9pm and midnight (using the Specific Times option) Check the Public Holidays option to specify which public holidays apply to you. Click the question mark for a full list of public holidays in each region. Contact PayAus if a public holiday from your area is missing. Choose which staff this award applies to. You should choose only one of the following options: If your award applies to staff of a certain age, you can specify these ages here. See age based awards for more information. Generally this will be the case if you have wage categories in your accounting package with names like “Base Hourly 16yo”, “Base Hourly 17yo”, “Base Hourly 18yo”, etc. This is an alternative to using multipliers in some accounting packages. See our age-based awards guide for more information. If you include the string {age} (including the brackets) in the name of your award, this will be replaced by the age of the employee when exporting their timesheets. The age is calculated based on the date of birth you provide. See our age-based awards guide for more information on how this is applied. This award applies to time clocked outside of a rostered shift. You can set an award to apply to all time clocked outside a roster, or only to the first few hours. If you enable this setting, it is very important to keep your rosters correct up to date. Time worked outside of a rostered shift will have this award applied. If any roster is entered incorrectly you could end up paying staff the wrong amount. To enable the setting, tick the checkbox. You can set a roster dependent overtime award to only apply for the first n hours of overtime. For example, you can have one award that applies for the first two hours of overtime (set the field to 2), and another that applies for the rest (set the field to 0). Roster dependent overtime awards only apply for the conditions entered in the previous sections. Thus you can configure a roster dependent overtime award to only apply for shifts on weekdays, or only to certain ages, etc. There are some limitations to be aware of when designing your awards: The following restrictions may be removed in future. Please contact PayAus if they are causing you issues. This award applies to the second half of a split shift. A “split shift” is a shift that contains a break. Thus, an employee has clocked in twice (start of shift, end of break) and clocked out twice (start of break, end of shift). If an award is set to apply to the second half of a split shift, the second part of the “shift” will be considered a separate shift and will have this award applied (the first part will be treated as usual). An area where this is useful is restaurants that are open for lunch and dinner. If staff get paid differently if they work lunch and dinner, you can use the split shift feature to have a different award apply for dinner. You can specify a minimum length (in hours) for a break to be considered a split shift. For example, if you entered “2”, then an hour long lunch break would not be considered a split shift, so this award would not apply to the second half, but a three hour “break” would be considered a split shift, so this award would apply to the second half. This is important because if you create a split shifts award, you cannot have an unpaid break in the same shift. The system will treat them as separate shifts (the first shift, including break, will be one row on a timesheet; the second shift will be a different row) and this cannot be reliably interpreted as a split shift. Thus if you use split shift awards you can either have a split shift, or an unpaid break, but not both (the number of hours you specify can be used to distinguish for individual shifts). If you do not specify a minimum number of hours for a shift to be considered split, but do enable this functionality, then all breaks will be considered splits between shifts. This is the default behaviour. If your award is dependent on how many hours the employee has already worked, you can set up these dependencies here. Add additional data about your award. This data is used in other parts of PayAus for cost estimates. Hourly rates take precedence over multipliers, and both take precedence over salaries, so you only ever need to provide one field. This data is not used by the award interpreter, except the weekly salary field. Awards marked with a salary will not be included when exporting timesheets to an accounting package. This is because most accounting packages allow you to automatically set salaries for staff, but those settings are overwritten if there is also a timesheet for those staff. Annual salary: the fixed annual salary this award pays. If entered, this is used as the cost estimate for staff on this award. You should set this award to apply “always”. You can enter decimals (eg. 61727.62 ($/year)). Hourly rate: the per hour rate this award pays, in dollars. If entered, this takes precedence over a multiplier. You can enter decimals (eg. 14.63 ($/hour)). Multiplier: the multiplier that is applied for this award. You can enter decimals (eg. 1.25 (x)). The multiplier is applied to the “base award” — the most generic award created for the employee in question that has an hourly rate. If no base award is found, it uses the employee’s hourly rate as entered in their staff profile. Thus, if you choose the multiplier option, you should either: Track time staff didn’t work. This information is used for tracking staff leave. When staff request leave, they are able to choose a leave type — if they choose this leave type, it will be included when exporting timesheet data using the award interpreter. Note that PayAus does not manage leave accruals. You will still need to tally your accurals separately."
