Couldn't make it to work? You'll want the sick leave to be recorded on your timesheet so your manager is away of it. Tracking your leave with PayAus is easy. To start, go to the [employee portal](../employee/):

![The web portal](/img/portals/web_portal.png)

Click the big link to *claim a day of leave*. You'll be redirected to the leave portal, which looks similar:

Enter in your passcode, the date, and the reason you couldn't make it to work. Click *Request Leave* and the portal will add this information to your timesheet automatically. Easy!

The leave portal is hidden behind a randomly generated URL, which means you'll need to get a link to it so you can actually use it. You can get this link from anyone who is able to log in to [www.payaus.com](http://www.payaus.com). Once they (or you, if you are able to log in) are logged in to [payaus.com](http://www.payaus.com), go to the menu in the top right hand corner. You should see a link to the **Employee Clock-in Portal**. From that link, you can navigate to the leave portal.

You may want to add the portal to your bookmarks in case you need to visit it again. How? That depends on your web browser, but these guides should help:
