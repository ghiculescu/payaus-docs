PayAus has three methods for [employees](../../staff/team/) to enter their clock in and clock-out times.

### Hardware Terminal

PayAus [hardware terminals](http://www.payaus.com/timeclocks) are installed in your workplace, and allow your employees to clock in or out simply by entering their passcode and pressing the appropriate button. The terminal maintains its own internet connection and sends clock-ins to the PayAus cloud automatically. Times entered via the terminal are marked as [verified](../../timesheets/verified-times/).

If your terminal is *not* showing the below screen, it may be that terminal has turned off, or the web browser that runs it has crashed. Ensure the terminal is connected to its charger and is powered on. Then, ensure that the web browser is running by tapping the PayAus icon on the home screen. **Contact PayAus if these steps do not fix the issue.**

### Web Portal

The PayAus web portal can be accessed by your employees from any computer. They can use it to enter times for clock-ins which they forgot to make using the terminal. Times entered via the web portal are marked as [unverified](../../timesheets/verified-times/).

There is a link to the web portal available in the site navigation. The link is unique for your business, so you can email it to your staff. If you are having issues with your terminal, you can use the web portal as a backup.

### Phone App

The PayAus phone app lets staff clock in without the need for a fixed time clock, and is ideal for businesses where staff work in a variety of locations.

The exact display of the phone app differs depending on the model of phone in use, but it should look something like this:
