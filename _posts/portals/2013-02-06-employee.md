Did you forget to clock in at the start of your shift? Maybe you forgot to clock out when you went on your lunch break. **Don't panic** &mdash; it's really easy to fix this using the PayAus Employee Portal.

You might have seen the portal before. It looks like this:

Just enter in your passcode (the same code you would enter into the terminal on the wall), and the date and time you were meant to clock in or out. The portal will do the rest.

The portal is hidden behind a randomly generated URL, which means you'll need to get a link to it so you can actually use it. You can get this link from anyone who is able to log in to [www.payaus.com](http://www.payaus.com). Once they (or you, if you are able to log in) are logged in to [payaus.com](http://www.payaus.com), go to the menu in the top right hand corner. You should see a link to the **Employee Clock-in Portal**. Easy!

You should add the portal to your bookmarks in case you need to visit it again. How? That depends on your web browser, but these guides should help:
