PayAus rollcalls can you a quick insight into your staff's attendance on a daily basis. rollcalls are delivered by email based on a schedule you define. You can access your rollcalls from the Notifications item in the main navigation bar.

## Start of Day

Your start of day rollcall tells you;

* who's clocked in so far today.
* who was rostered to start by now &mdash; filtered between those who have clocked in, and those who have not.
* who started work late.

## End of Day

Your end of day rollcall tells you who has not clocked out to go home for the day.

It's smart enough to take into account people's lunch breaks, and generally can paint an accurate picture of who is still at work. Each listing in the rollcall includes a link to that staff member's timesheet, so you can verify if have made a mistake with their clock-outs.

You can set a rollcall to be sent as many times as you like, by entering the times you'd like it to be sent at, separated by commas. Similarly, you can specify multiple comma-separated email addresses. You can use the ticks or crosses to specify if it should be sent every day, or just on weekdays or weekends. And disabling a rollcall completely is easy; just click the green bar. The bar will turn red; click it again to turn the rollcall back on.
