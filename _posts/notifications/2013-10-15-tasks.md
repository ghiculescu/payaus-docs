## Incomplete Timesheet Reminders

PayAus is able to [remind staff to fill out their timesheets](../../timesheets/reminding/) by email or SMS. You can set up emails to send automatically &mdash; they'll be sent on the first day of the timesheet week, for incomplete timesheets in the previous week.

Enable the reminders by clicking the green bar (you can click the bar again to disable it). If you'd like to be notified when the reminders have been sent, you can enter one or more emails to be notified at. PayAus will add a [comment](../../notifications/comment) to each timesheet that has a reminder sent.

## Copy Rosters to Next Week

PayAus can automatically create rosters for you on a weekly basis. Rosters are created at 9am on the last day of the roster week, for the next week. A roster will be created if there is an existing roster for this week, but no roster for next week.

Enable this by clicking the green bar (you can click the bar again to disable it). If you'd like to be notified when a roster has been created, you can enter one or more emails to be notified at.
