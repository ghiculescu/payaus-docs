## Incomplete Timesheet Reminders

PayAus is able to [remind staff to fill out their timesheets](../../timesheets/reminding/) by email or SMS. You can set up emails to send automatically &mdash; they'll be sent on the first day of the timesheet week, for incomplete timesheets in the previous week.

**TODO TODO TODO** You can enable this task from the [notifications](../intro/) page, by entering one or more emails separated by commas. Then, enable the report by clicking the green bar (you can click the bar again to disable it).
