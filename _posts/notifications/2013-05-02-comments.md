Comments allow you to discuss various entities within a PayAus system. You can comment on [timesheets](../../timesheets/) or [rosters](../../rosters/). To open the comments for an entity, click on the comments icon. The icon will show up in red if there are already comments.

Clicking the icon will bring up the comments view:

Entering a comment is easy - just type in the space provided and click *Add comment* when you're ready. Comments are only visible to [managers and organisation admins](../../staff/team/#roles) &mdash; not to the employee in question (unless they're also a manager).

Once you post a comment it will appear in the comments list. You are always able to delete your own comments, and organisation admins can delete any comment.

When posting a comment, you can also send a notification to all other team mates who have commented, by ticking the checkbox just above the *Add comment* button. When your comment is posted, everyone who has commented will get an email.

The email contains the contents of your comment, so be careful with what you post - deleting your comment won't make notification emails go away!
