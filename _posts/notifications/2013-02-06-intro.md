PayAus offers a variety of notifications which can help you keep on top of your business as it's happening.

![Notifications can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/notifications/notif_navbar.png)

### Rollcalls

Daily rollcalls can give you key metrics on your staff attendance. Get morning rollcalls that tell you who's in and who's running late, and afternoon rollcalls for staff who forgot to clock out... or forgot to go home.

### Clock-in tracking
