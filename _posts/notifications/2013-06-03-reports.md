PayAus can send you a weekly report breaking down your rostered and actual costs for the week that was. The report is delivered to your inbox on the first day of the week. You can enable the report from the [notifications](../intro/) page, by entering one or more emails separated by commas. Then, enable the report by clicking the green bar (you can click the bar again to disable it).
