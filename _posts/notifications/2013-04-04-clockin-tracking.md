Want to keep tabs on a particular employee who keeps turning up late (or not at all)? Want to check who was first to work this morning? PayAus can send you an SMS the moment someone clocks in or out of the office. You can enable clock-in tracking from the [notifications page](../intro/).

Tracking an employee's clock-ins is easy. Just type their name into the autocomplete box, and click their name when it shows up. Then, click the crosses in the appropriate columns to turn them in to ticks. Tick both columns to track clock-ins *and* clock-outs. To stop tracking someone, click the delete icon.

When an employee you're tracking clocks in or out, you'll get an SMS.

  	If you leave clock-in tracking on for a lot of staff, you'll get a <b>lot</b> of text messages. For your own sanity, only use it when you need it!
