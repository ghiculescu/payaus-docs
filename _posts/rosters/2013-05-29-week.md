Week view shows a summary of all your staff's rostered hours for the week. You can edit times, copy or swap shifts, or delete shifts, while getting an overview of the entire roster.

### Creating shifts

To create a shift, type the name of the person you'd like to roster in the *Add...* box at the bottom of the day. Once you've added the person to the list, you can enter the start and end times for the shift. Switch to [day view](../day/) for more fine grained control.

### Editing shifts

Shifts can be edited by changing the start and finish times in the text boxes on each schedule.

### Swapping shifts

The process for swapping shifts is simple. Just drag and drop each of the shifts to their new location. You can drag a drop a shift by grabbing it by either of the handles. The <i class="icon-move"> </i> move icon moves a shift to a new day. The <i class="icon-share"> </i> copy icon copies a shift to a new day as well as keeping the existing shift.

[This short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rycV6Ed2elI) demonstrates the two options for dragging and dropping shifts.

### Deleting shifts

There are two ways to delete a shift. The first option is to click the <i class="icon-trash"> </i> trash icon in any shift, which will remove it instantly. The second option is to drag it to the trash at the bottom of the roster. Either of the drag handles can be used to move the shift to the trash.
