Filling the same roster for someone each week is no fun. Let PayAus do it for you!

![The option to star a roster](/img/rosters/star_roster.png)

Clicking the <i class="toggle icon-star-empty"> </i> star icon next to any employee's roster will mark this roster as a favourite. Click the icon again (<i class="toggle icon-star"> </i> it'll be shaded in now) to remove it as a favourite. When you click the icon, you'll see a notification indicating what's happened.

When you add an employee to a new roster, PayAus checks if you have already starred a roster for them. If you have, the times from the starred roster are copied into the new roster. So in this example, if we are creating a roster for the next week and want to add Lana to it:

![Adding Lana to an empty roster](/img/rosters/add_user_lana.png)

Then her roster will automatically be loaded with all the times from the starred roster:

If you change the times that someone works each week and would like to make that the new default, simply click the <i class="toggle icon-star-empty"> </i> star icon for that roster. The previously starred roster will no longer be used.
