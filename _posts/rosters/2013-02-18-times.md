You've filled this roster with [staff](../user-management/) &mdash; what's next? Well, they need their schedules filled in. There are a few ways of doing this.

### Copying from last week

The easiest way to fill out your roster is to copy the previous week's.

The **Copy from last week** button copies the previous week's roster in *all its detail*. This will overwrite anything you have on your current roster, which is why it's only available when your roster is empty. From here, it's easy to tweak the roster to perfection for this week.

This button won't do anything if there *isn't* a previous roster, so in that case you'll have to do things the manual way...

### Scheduling a shift

PayAus rosters are weekly, and have seven columns; one for each weekday. To schedule someone to work on a particular day, you just need to set a starting and finishing time for that shift. Click on the green box for a start time, or the red box for a finish time, then choose a time from the pulldown menu that appears.

What about people who work the same time every day, like your full time or salaried staff? It would be annoying to have to set the same time for each day, and luckily you don't have to. The *Actions* menus in the far right column do this for you. They're even smart enough to only fill out weekdays, leaving weekends blank (unless you want to fill them out specifically).

### Error checking

Entered a time incorrectly? No worries &mdash; either click on the time to choose a new one from the pulldown menu, or click the  <i class="icon-ban-circle"> </i> delete icon to clear it out. If you want to clear out an entire week's worth of times for a particular employee, you can click the <i class="icon-trash"> </i> trash can icon just under their name.

### Saving your changes

Your work is saved in real time, and you'll see a notification in the bottom right corner of the screen when changes have been saved.

Of course, if you want to do things manually, you can click the **Update Roster** button at the bottom at any time to ensure your work has been saved.
