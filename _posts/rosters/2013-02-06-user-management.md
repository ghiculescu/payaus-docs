The first thing any roster needs is employees to fill it. There are a few ways to add staff to a PayAus roster, and they're all located at the bottom.

We'll start from the bottom. The **Copy last week** button is quite powerful; this button copies the previous week's roster in *all its detail*. This will overwrite anything you have on your current roster, which is why it's only available when your roster is empty. That said, like with any powerful tool, use this button with care.

The **Add all staff** button is similarly powerful. This gets all of your [employees](../../staff/team/#roles) and adds them to the roster. It doesn't copy their times, or anything like that &mdash; just adds their names to the roster so you can start setting times for them. If you have a lot of staff, this could take a few moments.

The **Add department** dropdown reveals [departments](../../staff/departments) in your organisation. Clicking a department's name adds all employees from that department to the roster. This is useful if, for example, only some departments in your organisation need to roster their staff.
