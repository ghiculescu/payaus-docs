### Adding Staff

The first thing any roster needs is employees to fill it. There are a few ways to add staff to a PayAus roster, and they're all located at the **bottom of the roster**.

We'll start from the bottom. The **Copy last week** button is quite powerful; this button copies the previous week's roster in *all its detail*. This will overwrite anything you have on your current roster, which is why it's only available when your roster is empty. That said, like with any powerful tool, use this button with care.

The **Add all staff** button is similarly powerful. This gets all of your [employees](../../staff/team/#roles) and adds them to the roster. It doesn't copy their times, or anything like that &mdash; just adds their names to the roster so you can start setting times for them. If you have a lot of staff, this could take a few moments.

The **Add department** dropdown reveals [departments](../../staff/departments) in your organisation. Clicking a department's name adds all employees from that department to the roster. This is useful if, for example, only some departments in your organisation need to roster their staff.

Finally, the **Add a team member** textbox allows you to type a specific employee's name in and add only them. The names of your staff will appear below the box as you type &mdash; click the correct name when you see it.

### Removing Staff

Removing someone from your roster is easy &mdash; just click the <i class="icon-remove"> </i> delete icon near their name. Note that this can't be reversed; you'll need to add them manually and re-add all their times if you remove someone incorrectly.

If you just want to clear someone's schedule, click the <i class="icon-trash"> </i> trash can icon. Read more on our guide to [Dates and Times](../times/).
