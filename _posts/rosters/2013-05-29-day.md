Day view shows a detailed list of shifts on a particular day. This is good for arranging shifts to ensure that all hours of the day are adequately covered. Drawing inspiration from spreadsheeting systems, day view shows a grid with coloured cells which represent what your staff are doing.

**<span style="color:darkgreen">Green</span>** cells indicate time at work.
**<span style="color:red">Red</span>** cells indicate breaks.
**White** cells indicate time outside of shifts.

### Adding shifts

To add a shift, choose a name from the drop down menu in the first column.

You can click the *Add all staff* button at the bottom to add all available staff to the day's roster.

### Editing shifts

You can edit a shift using the spreadsheet style grid. Single click on a cell to mark it as working. Double click a cell to get a list of options for that cell. Click and drag to copy a cell to neighbouring cells. Alternatively, you can enter times directly in to the start and finish columns to the left.

### Saving changes

Your changes in day view are saved if you switch to another view ([week view](../week/), [costs view](../costs/), or another day) or if you click the *Save* button at the bottom. Changes are *not* saved automatically &mdash; be sure to click *Save* if you don't want to lose them!
