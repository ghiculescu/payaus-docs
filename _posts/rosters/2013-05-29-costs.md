Costs view gives you a detailed analysis in to how much your roster will cost. Costs are broken down by employee and day. They are calculated using data from your [awards](../../payroll/), or based on the [hourly rates](../../staff/team/#fields_available) you've entered for your staff.

As you make changes to your roster, cost view will update accordingly. Check back regularly to make sure you're keeping under budget.

### Cost guides

While viewing a roster, either in full or for a particular department or tag, you're be able to set a cost guide for the visible portion of the roster. PayAus then determines how close you are to that cost guide, as a percentage.

You can enter any number you like in the cost guide field. For example, you could enter a target cost for the roster (as done in the screenshot below). Alternatively, you could enter a sales target, and advise managers that the roster can't exceed 30% of the target. The important point is to be aware of your target percentage and work with it when designing your roster.

Cost guides for an entire roster, and department-specific cost guides, are separate. So you can have a cost guide for each department's roster, and an entirely different cost guide for the complete roster.

You can save the cost guide amount by changing view or clicking the *Save* button.

### Fixed Costs

When viewing a roster for all departments, you're able to enter a number into the Fixed Costs field. This amount is added to the total cost of your roster. This is useful if there is a fixed overhead you must take into account when budgeting your rosters.

Fixed costs are saved alongside your roster when you change view or click the *Save* button.
