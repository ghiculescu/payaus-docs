Costs view gives you a detailed analysis in to how much your roster will cost. Costs are broken down by employee, by day, based on the [hourly rates](../../staff/team/#fields_available) stored in PayAus.

As you make changes to your roster, cost view will update accordingly. Check back regularly to make sure you're keeping under budget.

### Cost guides

If you are viewing a roster for a particular department, you will be able to set a cost guide for that portion of the roster. PayAus will then determine how close to you are to that cost guide, as a percentage.

You can enter any number you like in the cost guide field. For example, you could enter a target cost for the roster (as done in the screenshot below). Alternatively, you could enter a sales target, and advise managers that the roster can't exceed 30% of the target. The important point is to be aware of your target percentage and work with it when designing your roster.

*Note*: If you are a manager of only one department, you will see the cost guide field automatically. If you have access to multiple departments, you will need to choose a department to view.

You can save the cost guide amount by clicking the *Save* button at the bottom of the page.
