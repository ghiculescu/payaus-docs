PayAus is great at telling you when your staff [were at work](../../timesheets/intro/), but it's equally good for arranging when they should be there.

![Rosters can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/rosters/roster_nav.png)

Here's what a PayAus roster looks like, in [week view](../week/):

Rosters are split in three views. We have a guide for each one, to help you build your rosters with ease. You can navigate between views using the headers at the top of the roster &mdash; click a date to see the roster for that day, *Week View* to see an overview of the week, or *Costs* to see a cost analysis for the roster.

* [Week View](../week/)
* [Day View](../day/)
* [Costs View](../costs/)

To help you design your rosters, you can add:

* [Tags](../tags/)

Once you've finished designing your roster, you can:

* [Share it by SMS or email](../sms/)
* [Print it](../printing/)

Rosters are weekly, and you can change the week you are looking at by clicking on the date displaying, then choosing a new week.
