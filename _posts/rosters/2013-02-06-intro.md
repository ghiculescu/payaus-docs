PayAus is great at telling you when your staff [were at work](../../timesheets/intro/), but it's equally good for arranging when they should be there.

![Rosters can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/rosters/roster_nav.png)

Here's what a PayAus roster looks like:

There's a lot going on in a roster, so we've broken it down into a few quick and easy guides. Check them out!

* [Working With Your Staff](../user-management/)
* [Dates and Times](../times/)
* [Starring Rosters](../stars/)

Once you've finished designing your roster, you can:

* [Share your roster](../sms/)
* [Print your roster](../printing/)

Rosters are weekly, and you can change the week you are looking at by clicking on the date displaying, then choosing a new week.
