Roster tags allow you to categorise schedules in your [rosters](../intro/). These tags are included when you distribute rosters by [print](../printing/), [email, or SMS](../sms/), so you can use them to include data such as the location of a shift. They are also useful in helping you to build rosters quickly and collaboratively.

## Managing roster tags

Roster tags can be managed using the roster tags form.

### Creating roster tags

Create a new tag by entering its name in the box at the bottom and clicking the plus (**+**) icon, or pressing enter on your keyboard. The tag is created instantly, and you are then able to edit it and add a colour.

### Editing roster tags

Edit a roster tag by clicking on its name or colour. You can enter a new name in free text, or choose a colour from the drop down menu. Changes are saved instantly. If you change a tag's colour, all shifts with that tag have their colour updated immediately.

### Deleting roster tags

Delete roster tags using the **delete** link next to each tag. If you delete all your tags, the default colour palette will return to your rosters.

## Using roster tags

### Working with rosters

Tags are used on your rosters to categorise shifts, using colour coding. This colour coding is then used when sharing your rosters, enabling you to add extra data (for example, a location) when sharing a roster. In a nutshell, roster tags create a meaningful mapping between the colour coding on your rosters, and an extra set of data.

You can use the colour coding menu in [week view](../week/) to change a shift's colour, and thus, its tag. At the bottom of each roster view is a legend of each tag and its corresponding name and colour.

When you are viewing a roster, you can filter it out to only show shifts with a particular tag. While you are filtering a roster by a specific tag, all new shifts created in the roster will have that tag applied (and will thus appear in the appropriate colour).

**You are able to change the a shift's tag in [week view](../week/) *only*. In [day view](../day/), shifts will appear in their tagged colour, but the tag cannot be changed.**

### Presenting roster tags

There is a [system setting](../../settings/settings/#title_of_roster_tags_field) which allows you to give a title for roster tags, which will be used when they are presented across PayAus. This defaults to "Tags", but you can change it to anything you like.

### Sharing rosters

When a roster is shared by [email](../sms/), tags will show up as an additional column alongside each shift.

This tag will also appear when sending a roster out by [SMS](../sms/). Note that messages may need to be split into multiple parts to include tag data, which may result in higher SMS charges.

Finally, tags are included when a roster is [printed](../printing/). Note that in this screenshot, the [title](../../settings/settings/#title_of_roster_tags_field) of the tags field has been set to "Location".
