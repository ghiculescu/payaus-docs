Your PayAus roster was designed to be shared! It's easy to send it to your staff via [email or SMS](../sms/), and equally easy to print out.

To print a roster, simply choose the `Print` option from the appropriate menu in your web browser.

The location of the `Print` option will depend on your web browser. These guides should help you find it:

* [Google Chrome](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1379552)
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-print-websites)
* [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/printing-webpages-frequently-asked-questions)
* [Safari (on a Mac)](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11878)

When you choose to print a roster, it is formatted to bring only the information you need to the forefront. All irrelevant information - such as the controls you use to actually design the roster - are hidden, so you can focus on what's important.
