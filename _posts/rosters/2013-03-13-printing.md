Your PayAus roster was designed to be shared! It's easy to send it to your staff via [email or SMS](../sms/), and equally easy to print out. To print a roster, click the prompt on the roster's page.

When you choose to print a roster, it is formatted to bring only the information you need to the forefront. All irrelevant information - such as the controls you use to actually design the roster - are hidden, so you can focus on what's important. **Printing rosters only works if you click on the correct link. Do not use the Print option in your web browser's menus.**
