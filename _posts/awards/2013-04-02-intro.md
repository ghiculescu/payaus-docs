PayAus allows you to apply the business rules defined in your staff's [awards](http://www.fairwork.gov.au/AWARDS/pages/default.aspx) to the data that's exported into your accounting package. Some accounting packages calculate awards automatically; others require specific data to be entered based on predefined wage interpretations.

## Using MYOB

In MYOB, employee allowances, or awards, can be handled through the use of [wage categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9156) &mdash; a subset of [payroll categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9122). Use MYOB to create wage allowances that correspond to the allowances your staff are entitled to.

For example, if your staff's award applies a multiplier of 1.5 on weekends, you could create a Wage named <i>Weekend Rate</i> with a multiplier of <i>1.5</i> in MYOB. See these guides on MYOB's support site for more information about Payroll Categories:

* [Employee allowances](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9156)
* [Payroll categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9122)

Then, you could create a PayAus award named <i>Weekend Rate</i> that applies to all staff on weekends. See our article on [creating PayAus Awards](../creating-awards/) for more information.

## Using Wage Easy

Wage Easy can calculate and interpret awards automatically. Wage Easy offers [training](http://www.wageeasy.com.au/index.htm?payroll/training.htm) on how to configure your installation to do this. Once configured correctly, data that you [export](../../timesheets/exports/#using_wage_easy) from PayAus will be mapped to the correct award by Wage Easy automatically.
