The PayAus Award Interpreter applies business rules defined in your staff's [awards](http://www.fairwork.gov.au/AWARDS/pages/default.aspx) to timesheet data that's exported into your accounting package.

## MYOB

MYOB handles awards through the use of [wage categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9156) &mdash; a subset of [payroll categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9122). Use MYOB to create wage allowances that correspond to the allowances your staff are entitled to.

For example, if your staff's award applies a multiplier of 1.5 on weekends, you could create a Wage named <i>Weekend Rate</i> with a multiplier of <i>1.5</i> in MYOB. See these guides on MYOB's support site for more information about Payroll Categories:

* [Employee allowances](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9156)
* [Payroll categories](http://myobaustralia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9122)

Next, create a PayAus award named <i>Weekend Rate</i> that applies to all staff on weekends. See our article on [creating PayAus Awards](../creating-awards/) for more information.

## Xero

Xero handles awards through the use of [earnings rates, a subset of Pay Items](http://help.xero.com/au/#PayrollHDIAddEarningRate). Use Xero to create earnings rates that correspond to the allowances your staff are entitled to. You can then [import these awards](../creating-awards/#xero) to PayAus automatically.

See [Xero's guide to pay items](http://help.xero.com/#PayrollPayItems) for more information about payroll in Xero.

## Wage Easy

Wage Easy is able to perform some award interpretations automatically. Third party applications, such as PayAus, are not able to import interpreted data into Wage Easy. Thus, you will need to rely on Wage Easy's award interpretations.

Wage Easy offers [training](http://www.wageeasy.com.au/index.htm?payroll/training.htm) on how to configure your installation to do this. Once configured correctly, data that you [export](../../timesheets/exports/#using_wage_easy) from PayAus will be interpreted by Wage Easy. Contact Wage Easy for assistance.
