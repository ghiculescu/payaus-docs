Creating a PayAus award is easy. From the awards, list, click the New award button.

![The new award button](/img/awards/awards_list.png)

The new award page lets you create an award but specifying the business rules that apply to it.

First, you'll need to give the award a name. This name **must** match the name that you've given this award in your accounting package. See our [background to awards](../intro/) for more information. Then, choose when the award applies, and who it applies to.

Awards are applied to shifts based on how specific they are, so an award that applies only on certain days will override one that applies all the time. For example, you could create an award for all your staff that applies all the time, and call it "Base Hourly", then you could create an award for "Weekend Rates" that only applies on weekends.
