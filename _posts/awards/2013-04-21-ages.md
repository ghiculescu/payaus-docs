In some work environments, it is common for staff to be paid a rate based on their age. PayAus awards can automate this process by automatically injecting your staff's age when [exporting timesheet data](../timesheets/exports).

There are a few steps to follow for age-based awards.

1. Ensure your staff have their dates of birth stored in PayAus. Add this on their [staff details](../../staff/team/) page
2. When [creating an award](../creating-awards/), ensure that the award's name includes the word `{age}` (**including the brackets**)
3. When creating an award, specify the minimum and maximum ages to which this award applies.

When exporting timesheet data, the following rules are applied:

* If the employee is younger than the minimum age specified, `{age}` in the award name is replaced with "U<tt>min_age</tt>" (where `min_age` is the minimum age specified)
* If the employee is the same age, or older, than the maximum age specified, `{age}` in the award name is replaced with "<tt>max_age</tt>+" (where `max_age` is the maximum age specified)
* Otherwise, `{age}` in the award name is replaced with the employee's age.

For example, given an award where the minimum age is **16**, the maximum age is **21**, and the name is <tt>Base - Normal - {age}yrs</tt>:
* For a 14 or 15 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - U16yrs</tt>
* For a 16 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 16yrs</tt>
* For a 19 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 19yrs</tt>
* For a 21 or 22 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 21+yrs</tt>
