Just as staff are the backbone of any successful business, so they are the backbone of a PayAus system. There are two aspects to staff in PayAus; your *departments* and your *team*.

![Staff can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/users/staff_navbar.png)

### My Departments

An organisation is made up of one or more departments, in which you can group your staff together. Departments can then be used to;

* Filter to staff from a specific department.
* Report on the performance on a department basis.
* Assign "managers" to departments, who are able to access PayAus but only have control over their department's actions.

### My Team

Your team are the people you work with. In PayAus, the team members you see depend on your account's [role](../team/#roles). You may see all staff, or just some in a certain department. Either way, you can use the My Team page to manage staff details, as well as importing new staff and exporting information about them.
