PayAus can automatically welcome your staff, giving them a quick and straightforward introduction to how they'll use it. The most important bit of information your staff will need is their passcode, and PayAus can send it to them by Email or SMS.

Welcoming your staff is easy. Just choose which staff members to send a message to, then click the appropriate button to send the messages by Email or SMS.
