Want to see all of a team member's clock-ins and clock-outs? Check out their clock-in stream. Getting to the stream is easy &mdash; from your team member's [details page](../team/), just click the link to see Clock-ins.

![Getting to the clock-in stream page](/img/users/navbar_clock_in.png)

The stream shows the team member's clock-ins in reverse chronological order, so the most recent appears first. If the portal used includes a camera, you'll see a photo of the team member as the clock-in was done. If the clock-in is [unverified]({% lead_post portals url %}), this is highlighted for emphasis &mdash; if you find someone is doing so regularly, as is Harvey in the screenshot below, you might want to remind them to use the [correct portal]({% lead_post portals url %}).

<div class="alert alert-block">
	<i class="icon-hand-right"> </i>
	<p>What's a portal and why should I care? <a href="{% lead_post portals url %}">Read all about it.</a></p>
</div>

By default, you'll see 10 actions per page, but you can change that to show as many as you like, using the tools at the bottom of the stream.
