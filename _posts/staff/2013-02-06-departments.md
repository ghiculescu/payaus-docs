Departments are the building blocks of a business &mdash; in the real world, and in PayAus. A department groups staff members together, which allows you to;

* Filter to staff from a specific department.
* Report on the performance on a department basis.
* Assign "managers" to departments, who are able to access PayAus but only have control over their department's actions.

Departments are displayed in a list, which shows essential department information: its name, its manager, and the number of staff in this department. You can click the <i class="icon-search"> </i> magnifying glass to see the department's staff.

### Creating a Department

Departments are created through the departments screen, which is accessible from the [site navigation](../intro/), or from the [My Team](../team/) page. Create a department by entering its name in the box provided, then clicking the plus (**+**) icon, or pressing enter on your keyboard.

#### Department Managers

Initially, a department will have zero staff, and therefore cannot have a manager. So the next step, after creating one, is to add staff to it. For more information about doing so, take a look at the [staff guide](../team/).

Once a department has staff, it can be assigned a manager. A department manager is a user of the PayAus system who has some additional power, but only over their department. Managers are able to view staff details, timesheets, and so forth &mdash; just like business managers can &mdash; but only for staff in their department.

You can assign a department manager by clicking on the manager's name, or the dash, if there isn't currently a manager. As with other details, changes are saved instantly.

### Deleting a Department

You can delete a department by clicking the <i class="icon-remove"> </i> cross icon next to the department's details. When you delete a department, its staff are *not* deleted &mdash; they have simply have their "department" field set to "none", which means they won't be part of any department. Of course, you can easily re-assign staff to another department via their [details page](../team/).
