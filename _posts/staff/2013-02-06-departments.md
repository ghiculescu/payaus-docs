Departments are the building blocks of a business. In PayAus, a department groups staff members together, which allows you to;

* Filter to staff from a specific department.
* Report on the performance on a department basis.
* Assign managers to departments, who are able to access PayAus but only have control over their department's actions.

Departments are displayed in a list, which shows essential information such as how many staff it has. You can click the <i class="icon-resize-full"> </i> expand icon to see and edit department details.

### Creating a Department

Departments are created through the departments screen, which is accessible from the [site navigation](../intro/). Create a department by entering its name in the box provided, then clicking the plus (**+**) icon, or pressing enter on your keyboard.

#### Department Managers

A department's manager has full control over staff in their department. They are able to view and edit [staff details](../team/), approve [timesheets](../../timesheets/intro/), and create [rosters](../../rosters/intro/). To add a manager for a department, click the click the <i class="icon-resize-full"> </i> expand icon next to department's name. Then, type the manager's name into the autocomplete box. Choose the new manager to add, then click **Save** to save your changes.

A department can have as many managers as you like. Managers do not need to be members of the department to manage it. This allows for very flexible structures for businesses with large numbers of outlets.

### Deleting a Department

To delete a department, click the click the <i class="icon-resize-full"> </i> expand icon next to department its name. Then, click the <i class="icon-trash"> </i> trash icon. The department's staff won't be removed; they just won't be members of this department anymore.

### Departmental Reporting

PayAus' flexibility allows you to add staff to more than one department. That's great if, for example, you share staff between multiple locations or branches of your business. But how does work for reporting?

PayAus lets you specify which department an employee should be classified under for reporting purposes. This means that reports such as "costs per department" will only include this employee's costs once, under the correct department, preventing double ups or confusion.

You can set the reporting department on the [staff details page](../team/#editing_team_member_details). If the employee is only part of one department, the reporting department will default to this, but you can change it to anything you like. If you don't want this employee to be included in department-specific reports (for example, if they are a manager of a multiple departments but not a "member" of any), you can choose the blank option.
