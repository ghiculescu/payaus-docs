The "My Team" page shows your staff. If you are logged in as an admin, you'll see all the staff you've entered into your PayAus system. If you're logged in as a [department](../departments/) manager, you'll only see staff from your department.

### Roles

Each team member can have one or more roles, which give them different amounts of access and control over the PayAus system.

* **Organisation Admins** have full control over the system. Generally, there should only be one organisation admin, which will correspond to the business' CEO, secretary, or accounts manager &mdash; depending on the size of the business. Organisation admins are able to set roles for other staff.
* **Payroll Officers** can view [timesheets](../../timesheets/) and reports. This role is best for your accountants or finance team, who will only use PayAus to process employee pay on a regular basis.
* **Roster Managers** can view, edit, and create [rosters](../../rosters/). They have no access to timesheets (except their own, if they are an employee).
* **Employees** use the PayAus hardware terminal or employee portal for clock-ins and clock-outs. They are able to view their own timesheets via the PayAus website.

An employee *can* have more than one role. For example, a HR representative who also fills out timesheets could have the *Oragnisation Admin* and *Employee* roles. Or, a senior member of staff who shouldn't have access to timesheets could have the *Roster Manager* and *Employee* roles.

A team member's roles can be set on their [details page](#editing_team_member_details).

### Adding New Team Members

![Adding a new team member](/img/users/new_team_member.png)

You can add a new team member by clicking the button in the header. This will bring up a form in which you can enter the team member's details. By default, the staff member has their [role](#roles) set to **employee**.

### Editing Team Member Details

The **edit** link on the staff list takes you to an individual team member's details page. On this page, you can edit a variety of information about the team member. You can even upload a photo!

![Staff details are easily editable](/img/users/edit_user_details.png)

The information available is based on your [role](#roles).

#### Fields Available

The information available for edit is:

* **Name**: used to identify the team member throughout PayAus. Because PayAus can export reports and other data to work with other accounting software, it's a good idea to spell this exactly as you did in your accounting package.
* **Employee Number**: this is used to identify the team member when working with certain accounting packages, such as MYOB. It is also useful for your own reference. Despite the name, you can also enter letters &mdash; in fact, you can use any character you like!
* **Department**: the department the team member is in. See the [departments guide](../departments/) for more information.
* **Tags**: you can apply one or more tags to a team member, which can be used for arbitrary filtering. For example, if you run multiple copies of an accounting package (eg. MYOB) in your business, it may be useful to tag some staff as "MYOB One" and others as "MYOB Two", so that you can [export timesheets](../../timesheets/exports/) accordingly.
* **Passcode**: the passcode used by the employee to clock in. [Read more about PayAus' clock-in systems.]({% lead_post portals url %})
* **Date of Birth**: this is used to calculate [awards](../../awards/age/).
* **Employment Start Date**: this is used to calculate [awards](../../awards/intro/).
* **Hourly Rate**: the rate the employlee is paid per hour. This is used to for calculations such as the cost of the employee's shift in a timesheet. This is an estimate and generally shouldn't be used as a source of truth.
* **Photo**: a photo of the team member. This is useful when verifying clock-ins, especially for people (such as finance staff) who may not otherwise recognise the team member.
* **Phone Number**: the team member's phone number. This is the number used to contact this team member when sending a [notification]({% lead_post notifications url %}), so it *should* be a mobile number. This is also useful for your own reference.
* **Email**: the team member's email address is used to log in to the PayAus website. It's also used for [notifications]({% lead_post notifications url %}).
* **Password**: the team member's password is used to log in to the PayAus website. While you are able to change it via the team member details page, you *should* suggest that they [reset their password](http://www.payaus.com/users/password/new) if they can.
* **Roles**: [as detailed above](#roles).
* **Able to log in to payaus.com**: this determines if the team member is able to log in to the PayAus web site. Once logged in they will be able to see their timesheets, as well as perform other tasks depending on their [role](#roles).
* **Is (name) currently an employee of (business name)?**: this marks the team member as "active" or "inactive" in PayAus. Inactive staff can't clock-in via a portal, log in to the website, or do anything, really. Generally you'll uncheck this checkbox when someone ceases employment.

### Former Staff

The very last question on a team member's details page is simple: does this person currently work at your business? If they do, you'll find them on the My Team page. If they don't, you'll find them on the Former Staff list.

![Former Staff can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/users/staff_navbar.png)

This ensures that no data is ever lost by PayAus &mdash; it's just moved out of the way. If you re-hire a former staff member, just go to their details page by following the link on the former staff page, and set them to active again.

### Exporting Staff Information

Staff details can be exported into a variety of formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON. For more information, see the [exporting](../exporting/) guide.
