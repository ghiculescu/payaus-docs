Your [settings page](http://www.payaus.com/settings) gives you control over the functionality of your PayAus system. Use it to configure key aspects of the system, such as the timesheeting algorithm, function. Access the settings page from the menu in the top right corner.

![The settings option in your menu](/img/settings/settings_menu.png)

The settings page is split into several categories...

## Shifts

Configure settings relating to *shifts*, a key component of the [timesheet](../../timesheets/) algorithm.

#### Rounding of shifts

Rounding will be applied to the clock-in/out times for staff when their timesheets are updated. This is split in to two different fields, so you can configure different rounding for clock-ins and clock-outs.

When staff clock in, the time of their clock-in will round up, if enabled.

When staff clock out, the time of their clock-out will round down, if enabled.

For example, if both increments are set to **15**, all times on timesheets will appear in 15 minute increments. So, if an employee clocks *in* at 8:50, it will appear on their timesheet as 9:00. If an employee clocks *out* at 5:05, it will appear on their timesheet as 5:00 &mdash; if they clock out at 5:23, it will appear as 5:15.

Set these settings to **0 (zero)** to disable them. You are able to enable one but not the other &mdash; for example, you could round clock-ins up in 15 minute increments, but keep clock-outs at their exact time by setting it to 0.

#### Apply shift rounding in aggressive mode

In aggressive mode, shift rounding is applied as described above &mdash; it is called "aggressive" mode because it requires employees to clock in *before* their start time, and clock out *after*, their finish time, if they do not wish to have time docked.

If aggressive mode is disabled, rounding is done to the nearest interval. For example, if rounding of 15 minutes is enabled and someone clocks in at 8:49, it will round down to 8:45, but if they clock in at 8:54 it will round up to 9:00.

Aggressive mode is enabled for clock-ins and clock-outs by default. It can be toggled for either category, or both.

#### Maximum shift length

The longest permissible length of a shift, in hours. This is used to determine where one shifts ends and another one finishes, and for certain edge cases such as overnight shifts. A reasonable default is **12** hours, though this varies between industries. Be careful when setting this to anything lower than 10 hours as it may break in cases of legitimate overtime.

## Breaks

Configure settings relating to *breaks*, an optional (but recommended) component of the [timesheet](../../timesheets/) algorithm.

#### Enable Breaks

If **checked**, a shift will have up to four actions: a start, and break start, a break end, and a finishing time. Breaks will be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will be [exported](../../timesheets/exporting/) with timesheets.

If **not checked**, a shift will have up to two actions: a start and a finishing time. Breaks will not be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will not be [exported](../../timesheets/exporting/) with timesheets.

If your staff do not get unpaid lunch breaks (ie. all their breaks are paid) you should disable breaks.

#### Automatic Break Length

If specified, a break of this length (in minutes) will automatically be applied to shifts which do not otherwise have a break. This is useful if staff have a fixed break reduction applied to their hours, irrespective of if they take a break or not. Breaks are applied to shifts automatically when staff clock in or out, and are [highlighted in orange](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) on timesheets.

This setting does nothing if [breaks are disabled](#enable_breaks). Set this setting to **0 (zero)** to disable it.

#### Minimum shift length for automatic breaks

If specified, only shifts of this length or longer (in hours) will have an [automatic break length](#automatic_break_length) applied.

Set this setting to **0 (zero)** to disable it. If this is disabled but an automatic break length has been set, the automatic break length will apply to all shifts.

## Managers

#### Allow managers to see staff costs

If enabled, managers will be able to see staff hourly rates and costs on [timesheets](../../timesheets/), [rosters](../../rosters/), and [staff profiles](../../staff/team/). If disabled, this data will be hidden from managers, and will only be visible to [organisation admins, payroll officers, and roster managers](../../staff/team/#roles). This is enabled by default.

#### Allow managers to share rosters with staff

If enabled, managers are able to send rosters to staff by email or SMS. If disabled, only [organisation admins and roster managers](../../staff/team/#roles) can. This is enabled by default.

## Clock-ins

Configure settings relating to *clock-ins* &mdash; the method by which data is entered into timesheets using [portals](../../portals/).

#### Method staff use to clock in

Staff can use [several options](../../portals/intro/) to clock in. This setting determines which option is in use, which has an impact on several parts of the system's user interface.

The default is "wall mounted time clock", which is the [preferred option for most businesses](http://www.payaus.com/timeclocks).

#### Minimum interval between clock-ins

Clock-ins that occur closer together than this number of minutes will be treated as duplicates and handled differently by the timesheet algorithm. This is useful for cases such as:

* Nick clocks out to go on his break
* A co-worker asks Nick to come take a look at something
* Nick clocks back in
* Nick spends 10 minutes looking at this document and providing feedback on it
* Nick clocks out again to actually take his break

In this case, the initial clock out, and subsequent clock in, are ignored. The final clock out (when Nick actually starts his break) are used.

Set this setting to **0 (zero)** to disable it. In this case, no action will be considered a duplicate (all actions will be recorded separately). **5** minutes is a sensible default for most work environments.

## Passcodes

Configure settings relating to your [staff](../../staff/) *passcodes*.

#### Default Passcode Length

When you go to create a [new team member](../../staff/team), they have a passcode automatically generated for them. You are welcome to change this passcode, but often it's handy to not have to come up with one. The passcode that is generated will be of the length specified here. A length of four is a sensible default for most businesses. If you have a *lot* of staff, or want to make passcodes harder to guess, you should set a longer length.

## Interface

#### Title of roster "tags" field

The title to use when displaying the [roster tags](../../rosters/tags/) field. This will be used when sending rosters out by email, SMS, or print, as well as being used internally when displaying rosters. You can give it a name that better describes your use for the tag, such as "Location". The default is "Tags".
