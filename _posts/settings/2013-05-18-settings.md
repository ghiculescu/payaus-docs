Your [settings page](http://www.payaus.com/settings) gives you control over the functionality of your PayAus system. Use it to configure key aspects of the system, such as the timesheeting algorithm, function. Access the settings page from the menu in the top right corner.

![The settings option in your menu](/img/settings/settings_menu.png)

The settings page is split into several categories...

### Shifts

Configure settings relating to *shifts*, a key component of the [timesheet](../../timesheets/) algorithm.

#### Rounding of shifts

#### Maximum shift length

### Breaks

Configure settings relating to *breaks*, an optional (but recommended) component of the [timesheet](../../timesheets/) algorithm.

#### Enable Breaks

If **checked**, a shift will have up to four actions: a start, and break start, a break end, and a finishing time. Breaks will be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will be [exported](../../timesheets/exporting/) with timesheets.

If **not checked**, a shift will have up to two actions: a start and a finishing time. Breaks will not be taken into account when calculating the lengths of shifts and will not be [exported](../../timesheets/exporting/) with timesheets.

If your staff do not get unpaid lunch breaks (ie. all their breaks are paid) you should disable breaks.

#### Automatic Break Length

If specified, a break of this length (in minutes) will automatically be applied to shifts which do not otherwise have a break. This is useful if staff have a fixed break reduction applied to their hours, irrespective of if they take a break or not. Breaks are applied to shifts automatically when staff clock in or out, and are [highlighted in orange](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) on timesheets.

This setting does nothing if [breaks are disabled](#enable_breaks). Set this setting to **0 (zero)** to disable it.

#### Minimum shift length for automatic breaks

If specified, only shifts of this length or longer (in hours) will have an [automatic break length](#automatic_break_length) applied.

Set this setting to **0 (zero)** to disable it. If this is disabled but an automatic break length has been set, the automatic break length will apply to all shifts.

### Clock-ins

Configure settings relating to *clock-ins* &mdash; the method by which data is entered into timesheets using [portals](../../portals/).

#### Minimum interval between clock-ins

### Passcodes

Configure settings relating to your [staff](../../staff/) *passcodes*.

#### Default Passcode Length

When you go to create a [new team member](../../staff/team), they have a passcode automatically generated for them. You are welcome to change this passcode, but often it's handy to not have to come up with one. The passcode that is generated will be of the length specified here. A length of four is a sensible default for most businesses. If you have a *lot* of staff, or want to make passcodes harder to guess, you should set a longer length.
