Tags allow you to categorise schedules in your [rosters](../../rosters/), or shifts in your [timesheets](../../timesheets/).

Roster tags are included when you distribute rosters by [print](../printing/), [email, or SMS](../sms/), so you can use them to include data such as the location of a shift. They are also useful in helping you to build rosters quickly and collaboratively. Timesheet tags are exported to your accounting system which is useful for job categorisation.

![Tags can be accessed from the main site navigation](/img/settings/roster_tag_nav.png)

## Managing tags

Tags can be managed using the tags form.

### Creating tags

Create a new tag by entering its name in the box at the bottom and clicking the plus (**+**) icon, or pressing enter on your keyboard. The tag is created instantly, and you are then able to edit it and add a colour.

### Editing tags

Edit a tag by clicking on its name or colour. You can enter a new name in free text, or choose a colour from the drop down menu. Changes are saved instantly. If you change a tag's colour, all shifts with that tag have their colour updated immediately.

### Deleting tags

Delete tags using the **delete** link next to each tag. If you delete all your tags, the default colour palette will return to your rosters.

## Nomenclature

In your settings there is an option to configure [how tags are referred to across the system](../../settings/settings/#title_of_roster_tags_field). You can make this anything you like. For example, set it to "Locations", and when staff get their rosters sent out to them, the roster will include the "location" of each shift.

## Using roster tags

### Working with rosters

Tags are used on your rosters to categorise shifts, using colour coding. This colour coding is then used when sharing your rosters, enabling you to add extra data (for example, a location) when sharing a roster. In a nutshell, roster tags create a meaningful mapping between the colour coding on your rosters, and an extra set of data.

You can use the colour coding menu in [week view](../week/) to change a shift's colour, and thus, its tag. At the bottom of each roster view is a legend of each tag and its corresponding name and colour.

When you are viewing a roster, you can filter it out to only show shifts with a particular tag. While you are filtering a roster by a specific tag, all new shifts created in the roster will have that tag applied (and will thus appear in the appropriate colour).

**You are able to change the a shift's tag in [week view](../week/) *only*. In [day view](../day/), shifts will appear in their tagged colour, but the tag cannot be changed.**

*As well as using roster tags, you can also categorise roster shifts by [departments](../../settings/settings/#categorise_roster_shifts_by_department).*

### Presenting roster tags

There is a [system setting](../../settings/settings/#title_of_roster_tags_field) which allows you to give a title for roster tags, which will be used when they are presented across PayAus. This defaults to "Tags", but you can change it to anything you like.

### Sharing rosters

When a roster is shared by [email](../sms/), tags will show up as an additional column alongside each shift.

This tag will also appear when sending a roster out by [SMS](../sms/). Note that messages may need to be split into multiple parts to include tag data.

Finally, tags are included when a roster is [printed](../printing/). Note that in this screenshot, the [title](../../settings/settings/#title_of_roster_tags_field) of the tags field has been set to "Location".

## Using timesheet tags

### Working with timesheets

You can add a tag to a shift in a timesheet by using the drop down menu.

When you export data to your accounting system, this tag will be included in the export. How the data is exported differs depending on the package:

* MYOB: "Job" field
* Wage Easy: ["Department" and "Job" fields](http://www.wageeasy.com.au/index.htm?payroll/tsimport.htm)
* Reckon: "Proj" field (works with your Reckon Class list)
* Xero: [Tracking category](../../settings/settings/#xero) if there is a tracking category with a matching name
