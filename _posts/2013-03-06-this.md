This site was generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator. It's hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

This site is open source! All the code is available [on github](https://github.com/ghiculescu/payaus-docs), and contributions are always welcome.

We use a bunch of useful [plugins](https://github.com/ghiculescu/payaus-docs/tree/master/_plugins) contributed by other Jekyll users, as one as one written specifically for this site; [lead_post.rb](https://github.com/ghiculescu/payaus-docs/blob/master/_plugins/lead_post.rb), which highlights the "primary" post in a category (and is used to generate the links on the home page). The tables of contents on posts use [jekyll-table-of-contents](https://github.com/ghiculescu/jekyll-table-of-contents), and the collapsible navigation on the sidebar uses [nav.js](https://github.com/ghiculescu/payaus-docs/blob/master/js/nav.js) (which should be branched out into a separate project one of these days).
