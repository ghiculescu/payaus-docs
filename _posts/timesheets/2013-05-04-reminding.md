Sometimes staff will forget to clock in or out of PayAus via a [hardware terminal](../../portals/). Sometimes they'll even forget to fix this using the [online portal](../../forgot/). When this happens, PayAus can help you remind them to complete their timesheets. You can automatically remind your staff to fill out a timesheet by email or SMS.

To remind your staff about their timesheets, click the *Send reminders* button when viewing the timesheets list.

You can also click the link while viewing the timesheet list, or an timesheet, to only send a reminder about that specific timesheet.
