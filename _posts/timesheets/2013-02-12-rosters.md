You can copy the times on a timesheet to future rosters. This can save you lots of time, especially if your staff work similar hours each week &mdash; while reviewing their timesheets, you could *also* be writing their rosters!

The copy-to-roster tool is available at the bottom of each timesheet &mdash; click on the *Tools* header to show it.

You can choose the start date from which your rosters will be updated. If your timesheets are fortnightly, two weeks worth of rosters will be updated, based on the two weeks in the timesheet. Click the copy button when you're ready. You'll see a loading indicator while the roster is being copied.

When the loading indicator disappears, your timesheet has been copied to the relevant rosters. Go to your [rosters page](../../rosters/intro/) to check it out.
