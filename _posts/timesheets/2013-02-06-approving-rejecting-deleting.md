## Workflow

Timesheets can be processed on a day-by-day basis, giving managers a simple insight into who worked that day. From the [timesheets list](../intro/), click on the *Approve timesheets* button to access that day's timesheets.

The day-by-day timesheets view shows staff that worked, or were rostered, that day. A big tick indicates if the shift has been approved. The cost column gives the total cost of the shift; changes to this column update the total cost at the bottom of the page in real time, but are *not* saved when the shift is approved.

Sometimes, you will see data that looks a bit odd. For example, you might see the first and third columns filled out as the start and end time. In this case, the employee pressed **clock *in***, when they should have pressed **clock *out***, at the end of their shift. If you find such errors, simply change times in the textboxes so that they are in the correct column before approving the shift.

Managers can also use the approve all as a handy shortcut, and can click the green button at the bottom to move on to the next day, if they are working through several days worth of shifts. Alternatively, click the calendar icon to go to any date.

## Statuses

Timesheets can have have one of three statuses: **pending**, **approved**, or **deleted**.

When a timesheet is first created, it is pending. This means it's a work in progress. As the timesheet's employee [clocks in or out]({% lead_post portals url %}), the timesheet is updated automatically &mdash; A new [shift](../individual/) is added for each day. Each shift can be *approved* by a manager; when all of the timesheet's shifts have been approved, the timesheet is considered complete, and is marked as approved. The approve button at the button of each timesheet is a shortcut for this &mdash; it marks all the timesheet's shifts as approved, and the timesheet as approved if the timesheet is complete.

If a timesheet is created in error or otherwise needs to be removed, it can be deleted.
