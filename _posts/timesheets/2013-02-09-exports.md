## Using MYOB
[MYOB](http://myob.com.au/) offers business software for Mac & PC. PayAus can import data into the MYOB AccountRight suite of products.

### Exporting from PayAus

Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by MYOB. To do this, click the *Export to MYOB* button on the *export to...* menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee's timesheets, you can export just their data into MYOB.

When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. [Click here to see an example file.](/files/MYOB_2012_12_31_1360538855.txt) The file has the extension `.txt`. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file.

### Importing into MYOB

Your staff in MYOB must have a **Card ID** which mates their PayAus [employee number](../../staff/team/#fields_available). An easy way to ensure this is to [import your staff from MYOB](../../staff/myob/).

In MYOB, go to the `File` menu, choose `Import Data` (or something similar, depending on your MYOB version), then `Timesheets`.

![Timesheet imports in MYOB](/img/timesheets/myob_menu.png)

The file you are importing is tab delimited, includes headers, and identifies staff by `Emp. Card ID`, so ensure you have chosen these settings if prompted.

![Import settings in MYOB](/img/timesheets/myob_settings.png)

When prompted as to which fields to import, select **Match All**. Then, click **Import** to finish the process.

  	If you get an error while attempting to import the file into MYOB, make sure you don't have it open in any other programs (such as Notepad).

Before importing data into a Reckon system, you will need to ensure that payroll has been enabled. First, [add the payroll menu item](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/inproducthelp/core/qb2k12/contentpackage/payroll/preferences/task_enable_setup_menu_item.html?family=pro). Then, [set up your employee payroll information](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/inproducthelp/core/qb2k12/contentpackage/payroll/setup_manual/fields_emp_pay.html?family=pro). When adding employee data, ensure that your employee names match to your staff names in PayAus exactly.

Once you have set up your employees for payroll, you can import the timesheet data from the `iif` file. To do so, choose `Import` from either the `File` menu, or the `Utilities` submenu of the `File` menu.
