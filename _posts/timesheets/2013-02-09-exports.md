### Exporting from PayAus

Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by MYOB. To do this, click the *Export to MYOB* button on the *Actions...* menu.

The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, for example, if you only want to export data for timesheets for a particular staff member from a particular fortnight, you could click on their name, then use the filters to choose the specific date.

When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. [Click here to see an example file.](/files/MYOB_2012_12_31_1360538855.txt)

### Importing into MYOB

Your staff in MYOB must have a **Card ID** which mates their PayAus [employee number](../../staff/team/#fields_available). An easy way to ensure this is to [import your staff from MYOB](../../staff/myob/).

In MYOB, go to the `File` menu, choose `Import Data` (or something similar, depending on your MYOB version), then `Timesheets`.

The file you are importing is tab delimited, includes headers, and identifies staff by `Emp. Card ID`, so ensure you have chosen these settings if prompted.

When prompted as to which fields to import, select **Match All**. Then, click **Import** to finish the process.

  	If you get an error while attempting to import the file into MYOB, make sure you don't have it open in any other programs (such as Notepad).
