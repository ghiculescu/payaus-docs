## Using MYOB
[MYOB](http://myob.com.au/) offers business software for Mac & PC. PayAus can import data into the MYOB AccountRight suite of products.

### Exporting from PayAus

Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by MYOB. To do this, click the *Export to MYOB* button on the *Export as...* menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee's timesheets, you can export just their data into MYOB.

![The export to MYOB button on the Export as... menu](/img/timesheets/export_to_myob_timesheets.png)

When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. [Click here to see an example file.](/files/MYOB_2012_12_31_1360538855.txt) The file has the extension `.txt`. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file.

### Importing into MYOB

Your staff in MYOB must have a **Card ID** which mates their PayAus [employee number](../../staff/team/#fields_available). An easy way to ensure this is to [import your staff from MYOB](../../staff/myob/).

In MYOB, go to the `File` menu, choose `Import Data` (or something similar, depending on your MYOB version), then `Timesheets`.

The file you are importing is tab delimited, includes headers, and identifies staff by `Emp. Card ID`, so ensure you have chosen these settings if prompted.

When prompted as to which fields to import, select **Match All**. Then, click **Import** to finish the process.

  	If you get an error while attempting to import the file into MYOB, make sure you don't have it open in any other programs (such as Notepad).

### Importing into Wage Easy

You can import the `.wtc` file using the automatical processing wizard in Wage Easy. In Wage Easy, click on `Wages`, then `Auto`. The wizard will open, and ask you where the `.wtc` file is located.
