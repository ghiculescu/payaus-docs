PayAus allows you to export timesheets into data files which can be read by a variety of accounting, HR, and payroll packages. This allows you to easily import your timesheet data and pay your staff much more quickly. You can export timesheets from the *Export to...* menu on the [timesheets](../intro/) page. Be aware that only [**approved**](../approving-rejecting-deleting/) timesheets will be exported. [Learn more about PayAus timesheets...](../intro/)

## MYOB
[MYOB](http://myob.com.au/) offers business software for Mac & PC. PayAus can import data into the MYOB AccountRight suite of products.

### Exporting from PayAus

Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by MYOB. To do this, click the *Export to MYOB* button on the *export to...* menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee's timesheets, you can export just their data into MYOB.

When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. [Click here to see an example file.](/files/MYOB_2012_12_31_1360538855.txt) The file has the extension `.txt`. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file.

### Importing into MYOB

Your staff in MYOB must have a **Card ID** which matches their PayAus [employee number](../../staff/team/#fields_available). An easy way to ensure this is to [import your staff from MYOB](../../staff/importing/) when you start using PayAus. If staff are already in PayAus, you'll need to check their details to ensure the employee number matches the MYOB Card ID.

[This short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gQPCU9STVg) shows the process of importing timesheets from PayAus into MYOB. For written instructions, read on...

The following screenshots step you through a MYOB import.

![Timesheet imports in MYOB](/img/timesheets/myob_menu.png)

In MYOB, go to the `File` menu, choose `Import Data`, then `Timesheets`.

![Import settings in MYOB](/img/timesheets/myob_settings.png)

Choose the appropriate configuration settings for the file you'll import: **Tab-delimited**, first record is **Header Record**, identify employee by **Emp. Card ID**. When you click *Continue*, you'll be prompted to choose a file. Choose the file you downloaded from PayAus, and you'll see the next screen:

![Matching fields in MYOB](/img/timesheets/myob_match.png)

When prompted as to which fields to import, select **Match All**. A list of fields will appear in the far right column, under *Matching Import File*. The first field should be *Emp. Co./Last Name*. Click on this field (in the far right column) and it should disapear. Finally, click the **Import** button.

Deselecting the *Emp. Co./Last Name* field forces MYOB to match staff by the *Emp. Card ID* field, which is the field PayAus uses to match data to MYOB. **It's very important you do this, or your MYOB imports are likely to not work correctly**.

Click *Import* to commence the import process. When the process is complete you'll see a message with the results of your import. <a href="http://www.payaus.com/about/us">Contact PayAus</a> if you get any errors you are unable to fix. You should now be able to process payroll in MYOB using the timesheet data you have imported.

### MYOB Troubleshooting

* If you get an error while attempting to import the file into MYOB, make sure you don't have it open in any other programs (such as Notepad).
* PayAus uses "Base Hourly" as the default payroll category, so data that has not been matched to a specific payroll category will be entered into that one. Some old versions of MYOB use "Basic Hourly" instead of "Base Hourly". If yours does, you should create a [PayAus award](../../awards/) with that name.
* After enabling MYOB timesheets, you may no longer be able to make specific provisions for employee allowances. If this happens, you will need to re-enable the relevant entitlements and deductions. This video shows you the problem, and how to fix it:

## Xero

### Setting up Xero to connect to PayAus

Before you can sync your timesheets with Xero, you'll need to configure a few things in your Xero account.

1. Your Xero organisation should be activated for Xero Payroll - this is only available to Australian organisations currently. You can enable Xero Payroll by clicking the [Payroll](https://go.xero.com/Payroll/Start) tab in Xero and following the prompts. See [Xero's guide](https://help.xero.com/au/#PayrollStart) for more information.
2. Your user account must be a Payroll administrator. Go to [Settings > General Settings > Users](https://go.xero.com/Setup/Users.aspx), choose your account, then check the *Payroll Admin* checkbox.
3. Your employee names in Xero must match your employee names in PayAus. An easy way of ensuring this is to [import your staff from Xero](../../staff/importing/) when you start using PayAus. If you already have staff in PayAus, you should check each name to ensure that it matches. Xero uses two fields &mdash; *first name* and *last name* &mdash; while PayAus only uses a *name* field. To match names with three or more words (such as Jean Ralphio Saperstein), PayAus will use the last word as the "last name", and the other words as the "first name". So in this case, the first name (for the purposes of Xero matching) will be "Jean Ralphio", and the last name will be "Saperstein". You may need to adjust your employee names in Xero to ensure they match this schema &mdash; the golden rule is to make sure the last name is always one word.
4. Ensure that you have created a payroll calendar in Xero. You can do this at Settings > Payroll Settings > Payroll Calendars. The calendar should match your PayAus timesheets, which are fortnightly by default.
5. Ensure that you have created Earnings Rates in Xero for your employees' awards. You can do this at Settings > Payroll Settings > Pay Items > Earnings. Once set up, PayAus will map its [awards](../../awards/) data to these earnings rates.
6. Ensure each employee has a payroll calendar and default earnings rate. You can set these up at Payroll > Employees > (choose an employee) > Employment.

### Syncing PayAus timesheets with Xero

PayAus will only export [*approved*](../approving-rejecting-deleting/) timesheets to Xero. Choose the *Export to Xero* button from the *Export to...* menu to commence the process. You'll be redirected to a screen where you can authorise PayAus to access your Xero account. Choose your Xero organisation and click *Authorise*.

![Authorising with Xero](/img/xero_auth.png)

<div class="alert alert-block">
  <i class="icon-exclamation-sign"> </i>
  <p>
  	You'll need to authorise your account every time you export timehseets to Xero.
  </p>
</div>

You'll be redirected back to PayAus, where you'll see a progress indicator. Once your timesheets have been exported to Xero, you'll see a results screen. <a href="http://www.payaus.com/about/us">Contact PayAus</a> if you get any errors you are unable to fix. You can view your timesheets at Payroll > Timesheets in Xero, and you should now be able to process pay runs through Xero using these timesheets.

## Reckon (QuickBooks/Quicken)

[Reckon Accounts](http://www.reckon.com.au/) provide business and personal finance solutions, previously known as QuickBooks and Quicken. PayAus can import timesheet data into Reckon systems.

### Exporting from PayAus

Timesheet data can be exported into a file readable by Reckon. To do this, click the *Export to Reckon* button on the *Export to...* menu. The data exported reflects the timesheets that are currently displaying. So, if you are only viewing an individual employee's timesheets, you can export just their data into Reckon.

When you click the button, a file will be downloaded to your computer. [Click here to download an example file.](/files/Quickbooks_timesheets_2012_12_31_1368010008.iif) The file has the extension `.iif` ("Intuit Interchange Format") but is structured as a plain text file. You can open this file in text editors like Notepad, or in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel, as a tab delimited file. [Click here for more information about the `iif` file format.](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/articles/HOW12778)

### Importing into Reckon/Quickbooks

Before importing data into a Reckon system, you will need to ensure that payroll has been enabled. First, [add the payroll menu item](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/inproducthelp/core/qb2k12/contentpackage/payroll/preferences/task_enable_setup_menu_item.html?family=pro). Then, [set up your employee payroll information](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/pages/inproducthelp/core/qb2k12/contentpackage/payroll/setup_manual/fields_emp_pay.html?family=pro). When adding employee data, ensure that your employee names match to your staff names in PayAus exactly.

Once you have set up your employees for payroll, you can import the timesheet data from the `iif` file. To do so, choose `Import` from either the `File` menu, or the `Utilities` submenu of the `File` menu.

![Quickbooks - import menu](/img/timesheets/quickbooks_import_menu.png)

You may be prompted to back up your company file before importing; do so. Finally, navigate to where you saved the `iif` file you downloaded from PayAus, and select this file. It will be imported into Reckon automatically.

![Quickbooks - import complete](/img/timesheets/quickbooks_imported.png)

See [this guide](http://dataservices.intuit.com/support/Articles/HOW19695) for more information about importing `iif` files into Quickbooks and similar systems, and [this guide](http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/articles/HOW12778) for more information about `iif` files.
