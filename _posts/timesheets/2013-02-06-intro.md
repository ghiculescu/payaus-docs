PayAus uses timesheets to give you a real time glimpse at your staff's comings and goings. Your staff use [portals]({% lead_post portals url %}) to enter their clock-in and clock-out times, and their timesheet is updated automatically.

Your timesheets list shows you timesheets for the filters you've applied. By default, it shows you timesheets from this fortnight. You can click the **edit** link to see an [individual timesheet](../individual/), and use the *Actions...* menu to access various [workflows](../approving-rejecting-deleting/) and [exports](../exports/). You can use filters on [departments](../../staff/departments/), [statuses](../approving-rejecting-deleting/), and dates.

You can also click on a team member's name to see their timesheets only. This is what an [employee](../../staff/team/#roles) will see when they log in to the PayAus web site.
