Different parts of your timesheet may appear in different colours. Learn more about what these colours mean.

### Green rows (shifts)

This indicates that this shift has been [approved](../approving-rejecting-deleting/). See the [guide](../approving-rejecting-deleting/) for more information.

### Red rows (shifts)

This indicates that the employee has [requested leave](../leave/) for this shift. See the [guide](../leave/) for more information.

### Pink boxes (actions)

Pink boxes indicate times that are [not verified](../../timesheets/verified-times/). They were entered via an [online portal](../../portals/employee/), so PayAus has no way of knowing if they are accurate. You can correct them, or mark them as verified (or both!). [Click here](../../timesheets/verified-times/) for more information.

### Yellow boxes (actions)

Yellow boxes indicate a shift that goes [overnight](../../timesheets/individual/#overnight). You can mark a shift as overnight by entering "AM" into the box while entering or editing a time. [Click here](../../timesheets/individual/#overnight) for more information.

### Orange boxes (actions)

Orange boxes indicate that the length of this shift's break was [overriden](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) by a manager, or an automatic rule. [Click here](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) for more information.
