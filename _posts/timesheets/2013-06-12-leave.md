## Recording Leave

### Staff

PayAus makes recording staff leave simple. Staff are able to record leave by entering the dates they weren't at work into the [online leave portal](../../portals/leave). That portal is availble anywhere with an internet connection, so your staff can use it from home, once they have the link.

### Managers

Managers can use the leave form to record leave for any employee. Here they can choose a date, reason, and number of hours of leave to claim. The leave form is accessible from the timesheets menu.

As a shortcut, managers can click the icon next to an employee's shift to record leave for that 
shift.

## Viewing Leave

### Leave Calendar

The leave calendar shows leave requests for the current month. You can use the arrows to navigate between months. Hover over someone's name to see details of their leave request, or click on it to go to their timesheet. The leave calendar is accessible from the timesheets menu.

### Leave List

The leave list shows leave requests for the current month. You can use the arrows to navigate between months. Click on the dates of a request to view the corresponding timesheets, or on the *delete* link to delete the request.

### On Timesheets

When staff request leave for a date, the corresponding shift will be highlighted in [red](../colours/) on their timesheet. In the timesheet below, the employee took Saturday off, but was at work on Friday:

When an employee requests leave, they are required to provide a reason. This reason is added as a [comment](../../notifications/comments/) on their timesheet. You can click the comments icon to see the reason that was entered.

![Leave request comment](/img/notifications/leave_request_comment.png)

You can leave other comments on the timesheet as usual. Notifications for comments you make will **not** be sent to the employee who requested leave (unless they happen to be a manager), as regular [employees](../../staff/team/#roles) are not able to see comments. Thus, if you need to discuss an employee's leave request, you should contact them directly.

## Exporting Leave

When creating an [award](../../awards), you are able to mark the award as applying to paid leave. Awards that apply to paid leave are appear as options in the "leave type" field on the staff leave portal, and management leave form. See the [awards guide](../../awards/fields/#leave) for more information.

### Excel

If you [export your timesheet data to Excel](../../timesheets/exports/#excel), leave data is included in the exported workbook.

### Xero

PayAus can automatically create Xero [Leave Applications](http://help.xero.com/help/PayrollManageLeave.htm) when staff request leave in PayAus. To do this, check the appropriate box when created your leave-based award. A leave application in Xero will be created automatically when staff request leave, or when a manager records it for them. This should be then included in your Xero pay run automatically.
