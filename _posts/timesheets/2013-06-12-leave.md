PayAus makes recording staff leave simple. Staff are able to record leave by entering the dates they weren't at work into the [online leave portal](../../portals/leave). That portal is availble anywhere with an internet connection, so your staff can use it from home, once they have the link.

When staff request leave for a date, the corresponding shift will be highlighted in [red](../colours/) on their timesheet. In the timesheet below, the employee took Monday off, but was at work on Tuesday:

When an employee requests leave, they are required to provide a reason. This reason is added as a [comment](../../notifications/comments/) on their timesheet. You can click the comments icon to see the reason that was entered.

You can leave other comments on the timesheet as usual. Notifications for comments you make will **not** be sent to the employee who requested leave (unless they happen to be a manager), as regular [employees](../../staff/team/#roles) are not able to see comments. Thus, if you need to discuss an employee's leave request, you should contact them directly.
