### I signed up for PayAus. What happens next?

Once you sign up for PayAus, you'll get a guided tour through the system. It will give you a brief introduction into how everything works. From there, the next steps are:

1. [**Import your staff data**](../../staff/importing/) from MYOB, Wage Easy, Excel, or a variety of other sources
2. [**Introduce your staff**](../../staff/introducing/) to PayAus
3. Get a [**time clock**](../../portals/). We'll contact you to arrange delivery of one, usually a few days after your demo. [Contact us directly](http://www.payaus.com/contact) if you don't want to wait.

### I see "password" and "passcode" a lot. What's the difference?

Your **passcode** is a numerical code &mdash; usually four digits &mdash; that's used to clock into a [hardware time clock or online portal](../../portals/). This is used to generate your [timesheet](../../timesheets/)

Your **password** is used in conjunction with your email to log in to www.payaus.com

You can see passcodes and passwords for your staff on their [staff details](../../staff/) page.

#### How do I change my password?

While logged in to PayAus, choose *Change My Password* from the menu in the top right corner.

#### How do I change my passcode?

If you're logged in as a manager or organisation admin, you can change passcodes for your staff. Just edit the field on their [staff details page](../../staff/team/).

If you've just forgotten your passcode, you can get it emailed to you by following the prompts from the [online portal](../../portals/employee/).

### Help! My timesheet looks weird!

#### What do the colours on my timesheet mean?

[Check out the user guide on this.](../../timesheets/colour/)

#### Why can't I edit some of the boxes on my timesheet?

If your timesheet looks something like this, and you can't edit some of the boxes (the start and end times, in this case):

![Restricted timesheet](/img/timesheets/restricted_timesheet.png)

It means you don't have permission to fully edit it. You should be using a PayAus hardware termianl to clock in and out - only make changes here if you forget to do so! (They'll show up as [unverified](../../timesheets/verified-times/) when you do.)

If you think this is incorrect and you should have full access to your, and others', timesheets, speak to your manager who can grant you access through PayAus.

### What shortcuts and abbreviations can I use?

You can use all sorts of abbreviations when entering times into [timesheets](../../timesheets/) and [rosters](../../rosters/) (in [week view](../../rosters/week/) *or* [day view](../../rosters/day/)). For example, if you wanted to enter 3:30 PM, you could write it in any of the following ways &mdash; PayAus is smart enough to know what you mean.

    15:30
    15.30
    15-30
    1530
    15 30
    3:30pm
    3,30 PM
    3:30 p
    330p

How about 9 AM? Try any of these:

    9:00
    9.00
    9-00
    9 00
    900
    9
    9am
    9 AM
    9 a
    9a

**Remember**: PayAus timesheets and rosters work in 24 hour time. Make sure you enter "5pm" (or "17:00", etc.), not just "5" (or "5am"!), for afternoons.

### Can I configure how PayAus works?

Sure can! Check out your [settings](../../settings/) page.

### How can I get more out of PayAus?

PayAus works great as a staff attendance and rostering system, but it also does so much more!

* Why not set up a [rollcall](../../notifications/rollcall/) so you can see who's at work while you're commuting?
* Still printing rosters? Try sending them automatically by [email and SMS](../../rosters/sms/).
* Let PayAus sync up with your accounting package to make paying your staff a breeze. Check out our [awards system](../../payroll/).
* Watch someone age over time by seeing a [photo stream](../../staff/streams/) of their clock-ins.
* Get a [text message](../../notifications/clockin-tracking/) when a particular employee clocks in or out.
* Check out the powerful reports available from your dashboard:
