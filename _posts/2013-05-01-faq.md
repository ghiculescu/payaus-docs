### I signed up for PayAus. What's next?

Once you sign up for PayAus, you'll get a guided tour through the system. It will give you a brief introduction into how everything works. From there, the next steps are:

1. [**Import your staff data**](../../staff/importing/) from MYOB, Wage Easy, Excel, or a variety of other sources
2. [**Introduce your staff**](../../staff/introducing/) to PayAus
3. Get a [**terminal**](../../portals/). We'll contact you to arrange delivery of one, usually a few days after your demo. [Contact us directly](http://www.payaus.com/contact) if you don't want to wait.

### I see "password" and "passcode" a lot. What's the difference?

Your **passcode** is a numerical code &mdash; usually four digits &mdash; that's used to clock into a [hardware terminal or online portal](../../portals/). This is used to generate your [timesheet](../../timesheets/)

Your **password** is used in conjunction with your email to log in to www.payaus.com

You can see passcodes and passwords for your staff on their [staff details](../../staff/) page.

#### How do I change my password?

While logged in to PayAus, choose *Change My Password* from the menu in the top right corner.

#### How do I change my passcode?

If you're logged in as a manager or organisation admin, you can change passcodes for your staff. Just edit the field on their [staff details page](../../staff/team/).

If you've just forgotten your passcode, you can get it emailed to you by following the prompts from the [online portal](../../portals/employee/).

### Help! My timesheet looks weird!

#### Why are there pink boxes on my timesheet?

Pink boxes indicate times that are [not verified](../../timesheets/verified-times/). They were entered via an [online portal](../../portals/employee/), so PayAus has no way of knowing if they are accurate. You can correct them, or mark them as verified (or both!). [Click here](../../timesheets/verified-times/) for more information.

#### Why are there yellow boxes on my timesheet?

Yellow boxes indicate a shift that goes [overnight](../../timesheets/individual/#overnight). You can mark a shift as overnight by entering "AM" into the box while entering or editing a time. [Click here](../../timesheets/individual/#overnight) for more information.

#### Why are there orange boxes on my timesheet?

Orange boxes indicate that the length of this shift's break was [overriden](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) by a manager, or an automatic rule. [Click here](../../timesheets/individual/#overriden) for more information.

#### Why can't I edit some of the boxes on my timesheet?

If your timesheet looks something like this, and you can't edit some of the boxes (the start and end times, in this case):

![Restricted timesheet](/img/timesheets/restricted_timesheet.png)

It means you don't have permission to fully edit it. You should be using a PayAus hardware termianl to clock in and out - only make changes here if you forget to do so! (They'll show up as [unverified](../../timesheets/verified-times/) when you do.)

If you think this is incorrect and you should have full access to your, and others', timesheets, speak to your manager who can grant you access through PayAus.

### Can I configure how PayAus works?

Sure can! Check out your [settings](../../settings/) page.

### How can I get more out of PayAus?

PayAus works great as a staff attendance and rostering system, but it also does so much more!

* Why not set up a [rollcall](../../notifications/rollcall/) so you can see who's at work while you're commuting?
* Still printing rosters? Try sending them automatically by [email and SMS](../../rosters/sms/).
* Let PayAus sync up with your accounting package to make paying your staff a breeze. Check out our [awards system](../../awards/).
* Watch someone age over time by seeing a [photo stream](../../staff/streams/) of their clock-ins.
* Get a [text message](../../notifications/clockin-tracking/) when a particular employee clocks in or out.
* Check out the powerful reports available from your dashboard:
