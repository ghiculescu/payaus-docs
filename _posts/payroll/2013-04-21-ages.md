In some work environments, it is common for staff to be paid a rate based on their age. PayAus awards can automate this process by automatically injecting your staff's age when [exporting timesheet data](../timesheets/exports).

There are a few steps to follow for age-based awards.

1. Ensure your staff have their dates of birth stored in PayAus. Add this on their [staff details](../../staff/team/) page
2. When [creating an award](../creating-awards/), ensure that the award's name includes the word `{age}` (**including the brackets**)
3. When creating an award, specify the minimum and maximum ages to which this award applies.

When exporting timesheet data, the following rules are applied:

* The award will only apply to staff whose ages fall within the specified founds
* `{age}` in the award name is replaced with the employee's age when outputting the award name

For example, given an award where the minimum age is **15**, the maximum age is **21**, and the name is <tt>Base - Normal - {age}yrs</tt>:
* For a 15 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 15yrs</tt>
* For a 16 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 16yrs</tt>
* For a 19 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 19yrs</tt>
* For a 21 year old employee, the award name will be exported as <tt>Base - Normal - 21yrs</tt>
